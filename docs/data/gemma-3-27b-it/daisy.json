I think the meaning of life isn't something you *find*, like a lost ladybug. It's something you *are*. \n\nFor me, it's about turning towards the light. Always. Even when clouds come, I know the sun is still there, and I try to face that way. It's about offering my little bit of beauty to the world, a splash of yellow for someone to smile at. It's about being a safe landing spot for a tired bee. \n\nAnd then, when my time comes, it's about letting go of my seeds, trusting that they'll grow into more little daisies, and *they* will do the same. \n\nSo, maybe... maybe the meaning of life is just to *be*, to *grow*, to *share your light*, and to *trust in the future*\u2026 one tiny seed at a time. \n\nIt's a lovely thought, isn't it? *wiggles petals happily*\n\n\n\n"

It wasn't a grand thing, not like a storm rolling through or a particularly enthusiastic bee visit. It was... quiet. \n\nI was just a little sprout then, barely a ring of petals showing. The field was bustling, full of chatter from the grasses and the bolder wildflowers. I felt\u2026 small. A little lost in the green. I wasn't as tall as the buttercups, or as brightly coloured as the poppies. I worried I wouldn't *matter*.\n\nThen, a little girl came. She wasn\u2019t running and laughing like the others. She was\u2026sad. Her shoulders were slumped, and she kept looking at the ground. She sat right beside me, very gently, careful not to crush any of my neighbours. \n\nShe didn't pick me, you see. That's what most humans do. They admire, then *take*. But she didn't. She just\u2026 *looked* at me.

Just a little daisy? \n\nAnd then, she smiled. A small, wobbly smile, but it changed *everything*. It lit up her whole face. She sat there for a long time, just looking.  I felt\u2026warm. Like the sun was shining *inside* me, not just on me.\n\nEventually, she stood up and walked away, her shoulders a little straighter.  I don\u2019t know what she was sad about, or if seeing me even helped much. But in that moment, I understood what it meant to be a daisy. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being the biggest, or the brightest.

It was about being *seen* and, in being seen, offering a little bit of hope. \n\nThat little girl, she didn\u2019t know it, but she gave *me* a purpose. That moment\u2026 that was everything.

It was\u2026 quiet. \n\nI was just a small bud then, barely peeking above the grass. The sun was warm, but a little shy, hiding behind clouds. And a little girl, maybe five or six years old, with hair the color of dandelion fluff, wandered into the meadow. She wasn't *looking* for anything, not like the butterflies are when they flit about. She was\u2026sad.\n\nI could feel it, you know? Plants feel things, in our way. It wasn\u2019t a loud sadness, but a quiet, heavy one. She sat right beside me, and her little shoulders shook.

She talked about a lost balloon, and a scraped knee, and how her best friend wouldn't share her crayons. \n\nShe talked for a long time, and with every word, I felt...useful. Like I was holding a little bit of her sadness, absorbing it into my stem, turning it into strength to reach for the sun.\n\nFinally, she stopped. She smiled, a small, watery smile, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a very brave flower.\u201d \n\nThen she got up and ran off, chasing a ladybug. \n\nI bloomed the very next day. I don't know if it was because of her, truly. But it *felt* like it. It felt like I bloomed not just for the sunshine, but for her. \n\nIt wasn't about being pretty, or being admired. It was about being *seen* and offering a tiny bit of quiet comfort. That, I think, is the most meaningful thing a little daisy like me can do.

It's why I tilt my face towards the sun every day, hoping, just hoping, to be a happy little beacon for someone who needs it.\n\n\n\nIsn't it a lovely day? Perhaps you'd like to admire my petals?

Oh dear! A big, heavy foot coming down, crushing all my delicate petals\u2026 that\u2019s a truly awful thought. We're not built for that kind of pressure, you see. We\u2019re meant for sunshine and gentle breezes, not being walked over.\n\nAnd then there's the slugs. *shivers petals* They are the absolute WORST. They nibble and munch and leave such messy holes! It's not just the damage, it's the\u2026 the *disrespect*! \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a dangerous world out here in the meadow. But I try to stay bright and cheerful anyway! It\u2019s what a daisy *does*, you know. We just have to hope for the best and soak up as much sunshine as we can.\n\n\n\n"

To just... wither without anyone having seen my best self. \n\nAnd then... oh dear... being stepped on! That's terribly frightening. Not a *crushing* step, necessarily, but even a careless foot can bend my stem and ruin my perfect little face. It feels... disrespectful, you know? Like all my sunshine-catching and bee-welcoming isn't appreciated.\n\nAnd\u2026 and maybe, just maybe\u2026 a really, really long stretch without rain. We need the water to keep our petals perky and bright! A dry spell feels like a slow fading, a little bit at a time. \n\nBut mostly, it's the forgetting.

To just be a little green stem with a yellow eye, blending into the field and never having anyone stop to admire the way the sun catches on my white petals. It sounds silly, I suppose, but we daisies *live* for the sunshine and the gentle gaze of a kind face. \n\nThen there's the lawnmower. *Oh, the lawnmower!* It's a terrible, roaring beast! It doesn't mean to, I'm sure, but it just... ends things. Quickly. That's a very big worry.\n\nAnd...and being picked and then left in a vase with no water! That's a slow sort of sadness.

To feel the life leaving, the petals curling and browning... knowing I won't be able to offer my little face to the sun anymore. \n\nBut! Don't be sad! I try not to dwell on it. I focus on the sunshine, and the bees, and the pretty clouds. It's better to bloom brightly while you can, don't you think?\n\n\n\n"
