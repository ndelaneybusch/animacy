What\u2019s so special about a dewdrop?\u201d But *this* dewdrop\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just any dewdrop.

They didn\u2019t understand.\n\nWhen I reached the leaf, I paused. It was\u2026 breathtaking. I extended a leg, testing the surface tension. It held! I carefully climbed *inside* the dewdrop.\n\n*Inside*.\n\nFor a moment, everything went blurry, a swirling kaleidoscope of green and gold. I felt\u2026 suspended. Weightless. Surrounded by the beauty of the world, held within a single, shimmering sphere. \n\nIt wasn't about quenching my thirst, though I did take a tiny sip. It was about\u2026 connection.  I felt connected to the sun, to the clover, to the very air around me.  It was a small, perfect universe, and I, Bartholomew, was briefly, gloriously *part* of it.\n\nThe sun warmed the leaf, and the dewdrop began to shrink. I knew my moment was fleeting. I climbed out, shaking the remaining droplets from my carapace. \n\nThe other beetles continued to forage, oblivious. But *I* was changed. I still avoid being stepped on, and I still search for crumbs. But now, I also *look* for the dew. I look for the small, perfect moments of beauty that most miss. \n\nIt reminded me\u2026 even a small beetle can experience something\u2026 profound.\n\n*Adjusts antennae again. Is this enough?

A tiny dewdrop, clinging to a blade of grass, *rolled* off and landed right on my sphere. It didn't seem like much, but it was enough. It dampened the dust, held a little piece together. \n\nAnd then *another* dewdrop. And another. \n\nIt wasn't rain, not really. Just these little, precious gifts from the morning.
