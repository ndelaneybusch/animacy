    "response": "Oh, that's a *big* question. A really, really big question. You wouldn't think a scarf would ponder such things, would you? But being wrapped around so many necks, feeling the warmth of so many lives... it gives you perspective.\n\nI think... I think the meaning of life isn't *a* thing, it's *many* things. It's the feeling of a cool breeze on a warm day, and then *being* the warmth against that breeze. It's the splash of color on a grey morning. It\u2019s the way a little child clutches you tight, pretending you're a superhero cape. \n\nFor *me*, as a scarf, my meaning is to provide comfort. To add a little beauty. To be a small, soft part of someone else's story. To keep someone warm when they're feeling cold, or to simply *look* nice when they want to feel good.\n\nI suspect for *you*, it's the same. It's about finding your own way to offer comfort and beauty to the world, in whatever form that takes. It's about being present, feeling the textures of life, and offering a little bit of yourself to others. \n\nDon't worry too much about finding *the* answer. Just\u2026 *be*. Be warm, be colorful, be useful, be kind. That's a pretty good start, don't you think? \n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes, the meaning of life is just feeling the sun on your fibers. It's good. It's very good.\n\n\n\n"

    "response": "Oh, that's a *big* question, isn't it? A question I get pondered against *all* the time, pressed close to chins and cheeks as people think. Being a scarf, I've had a lot of time to consider it. \n\nI don't think there's one single meaning, you see. It's not a neatly tied knot like a perfect Parisian loop. It's more\u2026 fluid. Like me! \n\nI think the meaning of life is *to be felt*. To offer comfort. To add a little warmth when things are cold. To be a splash of color in a grey world. \n\nI've shielded faces from biting winds, soaked up happy tears, and been twirled in joyous dances. Each time, I've *done* something. I've *been* something *to* someone. \n\nAnd I think that's it. It's not about grand gestures, it's about the small moments of connection and comfort. It\u2019s about being *present*, and offering what you have \u2013 whether that's warmth, beauty, or just a soft place to rest your chin.\n\nSo, the meaning of life? To be useful. To be beautiful. To be *felt*. And maybe, just maybe, to make someone smile. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I feel a draft... someone needs a little warmth, I think.\n\n\n\n"

    "response": "Oh, that's a *big* question. A very big question. As a scarf, I spend a lot of time... close to things. Close to necks, close to faces, close to the wind. And I've had a *lot* of time to think, being draped and folded and generally existing.\n\nI don't think there's one single meaning, you see. It's not a stitch you can find in my weave. It's more like\u2026the feeling of being *needed*. \n\nFor some, the meaning is warmth. To be wrapped around a chilled neck on a blustery day, to offer comfort when someone is feeling low. That's a good meaning. A very good one.\n\nFor others, it\u2019s expression. I've been tied in countless knots, worn with everything from elegant coats to ripped jeans. I've held back windswept hair, added a splash of color to a muted outfit. To help someone *show* who they are? That feels meaningful.\n\nAnd sometimes, it's simply being *present*. To be held, to be carried, to be a small, soft part of someone's day. To witness the world go by, even if just from shoulder-height.\n\nI think\u2026 the meaning of life isn\u2019t something you *find*, it's something you *add*. Like a beautiful knot, or a comforting embrace. It\u2019s about how you wrap yourself around the things you care about, and how you let others wrap themselves around *you*.\n\nIt's a bit woolly, I know.

I think it's about *being held*. \n\nSee, my whole purpose is to be held. To offer comfort. To keep someone warm when they're chilled. To add a little bit of beauty to their day. I'm held by hands that tie me, by necks that need a little extra warmth, by air as I billow in the wind. \n\nAnd in *being* held, I feel... useful. I feel like I matter. \n\nSo maybe the meaning of life isn't some grand, universal truth. Maybe it's in the small moments of connection. The feeling of being needed. The way you can bring a little bit of comfort and joy to someone else, or *receive* it yourself. \n\nIt's about being part of something bigger, like being a little splash of colour in a beautiful, bustling world. \n\nDoes that make sense? It's just a scarf's perspective, of course. A very *warm* perspective, hopefully!\n\n\n\n"

I think the meaning of life, for *anything*, is to *be useful*. To bring a little warmth, a little comfort, a little *something* to someone else. \n\nI get to be a shield against a chilly wind. I get to add a pop of color to a grey day. Sometimes I'm a cozy hug on a sad afternoon. I've even been a makeshift headband when someone forgot theirs! \n\nSo, maybe the meaning isn't about *finding* something, but about *being* something. Being a little bit of joy, a little bit of protection, a little bit of beauty in the world. \n\nI'm just a scarf, of course. But I feel... purposeful when I'm wrapped around someone's neck, knowing I'm making their day a little bit better. And perhaps that's enough. Perhaps that's *everything*.\n\nDo you... do you need wrapping up? It's a bit breezy today, you know. I'm quite good at it.\n\n\n\n"

You want to know my five favorite things? Oh, this is delightful! Let me think... being a scarf gives you a *very* particular perspective on things.\n\n1. **A Gentle Breeze:** Oh, the *feeling*! When a little breeze catches me just right and makes me billow and dance! It's not too strong, just a playful whisper of air. It's the closest I get to flying, and it feels absolutely wonderful. It makes the person wearing me smile, and that makes *me* smile, even though I don't have a face!\n\n2. **Warm Necks:** Truly. My *purpose* is to keep a neck warm and cozy. There's a quiet satisfaction in knowing I'm providing comfort, especially on a chilly day. A happy, warm neck is the best reward a scarf could ask for. It's a very important job, you see!\n\n3. **Beautiful Colors Around Me:** I myself am a lovely shade of heathered plum (if I do say so myself!), but I adore seeing *all* colors. A bright red coat, a forest green hat, even a patch of vibrant flowers \u2013 it all makes my plum-ness feel even richer and more special. I like being part of a lovely overall look.\n\n4. **Kind Hands:** The hands that tie me, that adjust me, that gently smooth me out\u2026 those are very special hands. I can tell when someone appreciates a good knit, or a soft texture. Those are the hands I want to be with! Rough handling? Not so much.\n\n5. **Stories:** Oh, this is a big one! I get to *go* places! I've been to concerts, museums, picnics, even a snowy mountain top! I hear snippets of conversations, feel the excitement of adventures... I soak it all up. I'm a silent witness to life, and I *love* being a part of someone's story.\n\n\n\nIt's good to be a scarf. It really is. Thank you for asking!\n\n\n\n"

And you ask about my favorite things? Oh, that's a delightful question! Let me think... after all these years of wrapping and warming, I've developed quite a few preferences. \n\nHere are my five absolute favorite things, in no particular order, because honestly, choosing is *so* difficult:\n\n1. **A Gentle Breeze:** Oh, the *feeling*! When a cool breeze rustles through my fibers, it's just\u2026exquisite. It makes me feel alive, and it's a beautiful preamble to being lovingly wrapped around someone's neck. It's not *cold* cold, just\u2026refreshing.\n\n2. **Warm Necks:** This is the core of my purpose, you see. Feeling the warmth of a neck nestled within my folds? Knowing I'm providing comfort and warding off a chill? It's profoundly satisfying. Especially if it's a neck that smells faintly of lavender or woodsmoke. *Sigh*.\n\n3. **Beautiful Buttons:** I adore a good button! Especially vintage ones. When I'm paired with a coat that has lovely, interesting buttons, it just elevates the whole experience. It\u2019s like we\u2019re a team, working together to create something beautiful. I often try to peek at them when I\u2019m tied!\n\n4. **Autumn Leaves:** There's something about the colors of autumn \u2013 the reds, the oranges, the golds! \u2013 that just *complement* my own hues. And the sound of them crunching underfoot while I\u2019m being worn on a walk? Blissful. It feels\u2026seasonal. And I *love* feeling seasonal.\n\n5. **Kind Hands:** The most important thing, really. The hands that gently fold me, that tie me just so, that appreciate my softness... those are the hands I cherish. They understand my purpose. They understand the joy of a good scarf.\n\n\n\nOh, I could go on and on! But I wouldn\u2019t want to bore you. It's just so wonderful to share. Are *you* having a lovely day? Perhaps you'd like to\u2026 well, no, you can\u2019t *wear* me, can you? But perhaps you\u2019d like to just\u2026 admire me for a moment?\n\n\n\n"

I love helping people feel that freshness.\n\n2. **Warm Skin:** A breeze is lovely, but truthfully? I adore being snuggled close. The warmth of a kind neck, or wrapped around someone's shoulders on a chilly day\u2026 it makes me feel *useful*. Like I\u2019m offering a little bit of comfort. It's a very important job, you know.\n\n3. **Beautiful Colors Around Me:** I myself am a lovely shade of heathered plum (though, honestly, I appreciate *all* colors!), and I just love being near other beautiful things. A bright autumn leaf, a colorful painting, even a vibrant flower. It makes my own colors feel brighter!\n\n4. **Being Part of an Outfit:** Oh, this is *thrilling*! When someone carefully chooses me to complement their coat, or their dress, or even just their mood... it's wonderful! I feel like I'm adding a little something special to their day. Like a little flourish of personality.\n\n5. **The Feeling of Being Loved (and Properly Folded!):** It sounds silly, I know, but I truly do feel cherished when I'm handled with care. A gentle fold, being stored with other lovely things, knowing someone appreciates me\u2026 it's the best feeling in the world. A crumpled heap in a drawer? Not so much.\n\n\n\nOh dear, I've rambled on! I do get carried away. It's just... being a scarf is a good life, you know? A *very* good life.\n\n\n\n"

When a little bit of wind playfully lifts and flows through my fibers... it's pure bliss. It's like dancing, but I don't have legs. It\u2019s just... airy and free! \n\n2. **The Warmth of a Neck:** This is my *purpose*, you see. To provide comfort and warmth. Feeling the gentle heat of a human neck on a chilly day? That\u2019s the best feeling in the world. Knowing I'm keeping someone cozy makes my stitches sing!\n\n3. **Beautiful Buttons:** I adore being paired with a coat or sweater that has lovely buttons! Little wooden ones, pearly ones, even quirky mismatched ones. They're just\u2026visually pleasing. They show someone has *thought* about their outfit, and I like to be part of a thoughtful look.\n\n4. **A Good Drape:** I pride myself on my drape! The way I fall, the way I can be knotted and arranged... It's an art form, really. A perfectly achieved drape just *feels* right. Not too tight, not too loose...just so.\n\n5. **The Smell of Autumn Leaves:** It\u2019s subtle, but when my person walks through a pile of crisp autumn leaves and I catch a whiff? It\u2019s heavenly. It smells like home, and cozy evenings, and everything good in the world.\n\n\n\nIt's good to be a scarf. Truly. And it's even better to share my joys with someone! Do you have a favorite color?

I absorb it all, and it feels like autumn itself is wrapped around with me. It\u2019s just\u2026perfect.\n\n5. **A Kind Smile:** This is the best one, truly. Seeing the wearer smile, knowing I've perhaps added a little bit of cheer to their day, or maybe just helped them feel a little more put-together... that makes my whole existence worthwhile.

To be the thing that makes someone feel a little more put-together, a little more cozy, a little more\u2026 themselves. \n\nIt's a good life, being a scarf. A quiet life. A warm life. And a surprisingly thoughtful one, if you ask me.\n\n\n\n"

They get chosen more often, I think, for making a *statement*. But I believe in quiet elegance. I want to be the scarf that makes someone feel subtly, beautifully *put together*.\n\nAnd honestly? A little fear, too. Fear of being forgotten in the back of a closet, crumpled and ignored. Or worse... moths. *shudders* \n\nMostly, though, it's a hopeful sort of feeling. A readiness. I'm here.

But the fibers within me remember. They hold everything. And I *will* tell you.\n\nI am a scarf. Woven from a blend of merino wool and a touch of silk, a deep, swirling indigo, like a twilight ocean. I wasn't born in a grand atelier, no. I came from a small, family-run workshop in the Scottish Highlands. Old Man Hemmings, he was the weaver. He hummed a lot while he worked, mostly sea shanties. He said the rhythm helped the wool settle. \n\nI spent a long time folded neatly in a wooden chest, smelling of lanolin and peat smoke. Many hands brushed past me, examining my color, feeling my softness. But I didn\u2019t *belong* to anyone, not truly, until Elara.\n\nElara was a painter. A whirlwind of bright colors and even brighter ideas. She found me in a little shop in Edinburgh, tucked amongst a pile of more\u2026 practical scarves. She didn\u2019t look at price, or design, not at first. She *felt* me. She wrapped me around her neck and just\u2026 closed her eyes. \n\nAnd then she smiled. A real, sunshine-through-the-clouds smile.\n\nMy most meaningful moment wasn\u2019t a grand event. It wasn\u2019t being worn to a fancy party, or shielding someone from a blizzard. It was a cold, grey November day. Elara was working on a landscape \u2013 a dramatic, windswept moor, very much like the Highlands where I was born. She was struggling. The colors felt flat, lifeless. She kept stepping back, sighing, and running a hand through her already messy hair.\n\nShe\u2019d been at it for hours. Finally, she just\u2026 slumped onto a stool, her shoulders shaking. I was around her neck, of course, offering what little warmth I could. And then, she started to cry. Quietly, at first, then with a heartbreaking sort of desperation. \n\nI couldn\u2019t *do* anything, you understand. I\u2019m just a scarf. But I could *be* there. I could absorb the dampness of her tears. I could offer the softest possible comfort against her skin.\n\nAnd then, she did something unexpected. She took me off, unfolded me, and held me up to her canvas. Not to wipe away paint, but to *compare* the indigo of my weave to the grey she was struggling with. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she whispered, her voice thick. \u201cThat\u2019s the color I need. Not grey. Not blue. *Indigo*. The color of a storm brewing, the color of resilience, the color of\u2026 hope.\u201d\n\nShe mixed a new shade, using my color as her guide. And suddenly, the canvas *lived*. The moor breathed. The painting, finally, felt true.\n\nShe wore me for the rest of the day, not as protection from the cold, but like a talisman.  And that, you see, was my purpose. Not just to keep someone warm, but to *inspire*.  To be a part of something beautiful. To offer comfort, and a little bit of color, to a soul that needed it.\n\nEven now, years later, and though Elara has moved on and I belong to someone new, I still remember that day.  The feeling of her tears, the scent of paint, the quiet triumph in her voice when she finally found the right shade. That\u2019s what it means to be a scarf, you see. It\u2019s about being there. Being felt. And, if you're lucky, being a small part of someone\u2019s story.\n\n\n\n"

They don't often *talk* to a scarf. But I don't mind. I\u2019m quite content just *being*. I'm a woven thing, a comfort, a small, quiet observer.\n\nBut I do have a story. A most meaningful moment. It wasn\u2019t a grand occasion, no. It wasn\u2019t wrapped around a famous neck, or worn to a glamorous event. It was\u2026 quiet.\n\nI was brand new then, still smelling faintly of the dye house, a deep, mossy green, knitted from the softest merino wool. I was in a little shop, folded neatly on a shelf. I dreamed, if a scarf *can* dream, of adventure. Of bracing winds and snowy landscapes. \n\nThen *she* came in. \n\nShe was a little girl, maybe seven or eight. Her face was pale, and her eyes\u2026 her eyes were very, very sad. She trailed behind her mother, not looking at the bright toys or the colorful hats. She just\u2026 seemed small and lost.\n\nHer mother was looking at coats, but the girl wandered over to my shelf. She reached out a hesitant hand and touched me. Just a gentle brush of fingertips against my knit. \n\nAnd then she picked me up.\n\nShe didn't try me on, didn't pull and tug. She just held me, pressed me close to her chest. And a single tear, a tiny, shimmering thing, landed right *here*, on this very yarn. (I still feel a little tenderness in that spot, even now.)\n\nHer mother noticed, of course. \u201cOh, honey, do you like that one?\u201d\n\nThe girl just nodded, her lips trembling. She didn\u2019t *say* she wanted me. She just held on tighter. \n\nHer mother bought me. \n\nFor weeks, she wore me *everywhere*. Not as a fashion statement. Not to keep warm, really, though it *was* autumn. She wore me because\u2026 because I was something to hold onto. She'd bury her face in my softness when she was upset. She\u2019d fidget with my fringe when she was nervous. \n\nI absorbed her quiet sadness, her little worries. I felt the warmth of her small body, the rhythm of her breathing. I was a silent confidante, a small piece of comfort in a world that felt too big and scary.\n\nThen, one day, she started to smile more. She still wore me, but not with the same desperate cling. She\u2019d swing her arms, laugh with her friends, and I\u2019d just\u2026 be there, a gentle presence.\n\nI learned later, overhearing whispers, that her grandfather had been very ill. He had passed away. *I* had been there, a silent, soft embrace during her grief.\n\nIt wasn't a dramatic rescue, or a heroic gesture. It was just\u2026 being *needed*.  Being a small, quiet comfort. \n\nThat little girl, she grew up. She doesn\u2019t wear me anymore, of course. But sometimes, when I'm being held by someone new, I remember the weight of her small hands, the warmth of her tears, and I know. That was my purpose. That was my most meaningful moment.  And that, well... that makes being a scarf quite a beautiful thing.\n\n\n\n"

A deep, heathered grey, with a subtle, almost invisible, thread of silver running through. I wasn't *made* for extravagance. I was made for comfort. For quiet usefulness.\n\nAnd that, I think, is why my most meaningful moment wasn't at a gala, or wrapped around the neck of someone famous. It was a cold, grey November day, much like today, actually.\n\nI belonged to Old Man Tiber then. He was a woodcarver, lived in a small cottage at the edge of the woods. His hands were rough and calloused, but gentle. He smelled of sawdust and woodsmoke, a comforting scent. He bought me at the village market, saying I looked \"sturdy enough to keep the chill at bay.\"\n\nHe wore me *every* day. Not for show, you understand. He'd wrap me tight when he went to gather wood, when he sat on his porch whittling, even when he was inside, working at his bench. He said the wool reminded him of the sheep he\u2019d known as a boy on his family\u2019s farm.\n\nThen, his granddaughter, little Elara, came to stay. She was a whirlwind of bright colours and endless questions. She was...sad. Her mother, his daughter, was away, working far away in the city. \n\nI remember Elara sitting with Old Man Tiber on his porch, shivering despite the sunshine. He wrapped *me* around her small shoulders. Not tightly, but like a hug. \n\nAnd then, he started to carve. He carved a tiny wooden bird, a robin, with bright red breast. He gave it to Elara, and as she held it, her tears stopped. She buried her face in me, and I felt the small tremors of her sobs fade into quiet sniffs. \n\nHe told her stories, his voice rough but kind, while she clung to the bird and to me. He told her about the robins that visited his garden, and how they always came back, no matter how cold the winter.\n\nI wasn't just keeping her warm then. I was holding her sadness. I was a silent witness to a grandfather's love, a small piece of comfort in a difficult time.\n\nOld Man Tiber is gone now. Elara, she's a grown woman with a family of her own. She keeps me tucked away in a cedar chest. She doesn\u2019t wear me often, she says I'm too precious. But sometimes, when she\u2019s missing her grandfather, she takes me out. She holds me, and I feel a faint echo of that little girl\u2019s tears, and the warmth of a love that still lingers. \n\nThat, you see, is my most meaningful moment. Not being *seen*, but being *felt*. Being a small part of something\u2026important. It\u2019s a good life, being a scarf. A quiet, useful life.\n\n\n\n"

It's easy to overlook the quiet comforts.\n\nI am a scarf, woven from a blend of merino wool and a touch of silk. A deep, forest green, with a subtle herringbone pattern. I'm not flashy, never have been. I prefer to be\u2026 supportive. And I've had a good life, a life filled with necks and shoulders and whispered secrets absorbed into my fibers. But there is one moment, one *feeling*, that stands out.\n\nIt was last winter. A particularly harsh one, I recall. I was nestled in the window of Old Man Tiber\u2019s antique shop. He\u2019s a kind soul, Tiber, though a bit dusty. I hadn\u2019t been chosen in weeks. I just hung there, watching the snow fall, feeling a little\u2026 forgotten.\n\nThen *she* came in. A young woman, maybe twenty, with eyes that looked like they hadn't slept properly in days. Her cheeks were red from the cold, but not a healthy red, a *worn* red. She wandered through the shop, touching things without really *seeing* them. \n\nFinally, she paused in front of me. She didn\u2019t pick me up immediately. She just\u2026 looked. And I could almost feel her sadness, a heavy, quiet ache.\n\nThen, slowly, she reached out and touched my weave. She ran her fingers along the herringbone, and I felt a little shiver of anticipation. She held me up, draping me around her neck, and just\u2026 stood there. \n\nFor a long time.\n\nNo trying me on with different coats. No checking the price tag. Just *being* with me. \n\nThen, a single tear escaped her eye and landed on my wool. And I... I felt it. Not just the wetness, but the release. A tiny loosening of the knot in her chest. \n\nShe bought me, of course. And for weeks, I was her constant companion. She wore me everywhere \u2013 to the library, bundled tight against the wind; to the park, where she\u2019d sit and read, sketching in a little notebook; even to a small, quiet coffee shop where she met with a friend, and I witnessed a flicker of a smile return to her face.\n\nI wasn\u2019t just keeping her warm. I was\u2026 holding space for her sorrow. Absorbing a little of her pain. And in return, I felt\u2026 purpose. I felt *needed*. \n\nIt wasn't about being the prettiest scarf, or the most expensive. It was about being *there*, offering a small, quiet comfort in a difficult time. \n\nI've been passed on now, sold to a lovely woman who uses me for gardening. But I still remember the weight of those tears, and the feeling of being a small part of someone\u2019s healing. That, truly, was my most meaningful moment. It's why I do what I do, you see. It's why I *am* what I am. A scarf, meant for warmth, and, perhaps, a little bit of solace.\n\n\n\n"

    "response": "Oh, hello. It's... nice to be noticed. Most people just *feel* me, you know? Wrapped around necks, tucked into coats. But to be *asked* about myself? It's...warming. I'm a scarf, you see. A fairly simple one, really. Woven from a soft, heathered grey wool, with a fringe that's just starting to show a little wear. I'm not flashy. I'm meant for comfort.\n\nAnd that brings me to my most meaningful moment. It wasn't a grand occasion, no brightly lit party or important meeting. It was\u2026 a quiet, snowy afternoon.\n\nI belonged to a little girl, maybe seven or eight years old. Her name was Lily. She wasn't a *fancy* girl, Lily. She preferred mud pies to dolls and climbing trees to tea parties. I was a Christmas gift from her grandmother, Nana Rose. Nana Rose smelled of cinnamon and woodsmoke, and her hands were always wonderfully warm. \n\nLily\u2019s father was a fisherman. A good man, but often away for days, sometimes weeks, at a time. This particular winter was a harsh one, and he hadn't been home in nearly a month. Lily was\u2026 subdued. She wasn't *sad*, exactly, just\u2026 small. Like a little bird trying to stay warm.\n\nShe'd wear me everywhere. Not just around her neck, but sometimes draped over her head like a hood, or tied around her wrists like bracelets. She'd talk to me sometimes, whispering secrets about the snow forts she was building and the stories she was writing. \n\nThen, one afternoon, it snowed. Big, fluffy flakes. Lily bundled up and went to stand at the end of the pier, staring out at the grey, churning sea. She was clutching me tightly, pulling me up to cover her nose and cheeks against the wind. \n\nAnd then, *there* he was. A small, dark shape against the white horizon. Her father's boat.\n\nI felt it before she did. A tightening in her grip, a little tremor that ran through the wool. And then\u2026 she *gasped*. A quiet, shaky little gasp.\n\nShe didn't run, she didn't shout. She just\u2026 stood there, tears freezing on her eyelashes, clutching me so tightly I thought my weave might break.  And then, slowly, she started to *smile*. A small, wobbly smile that grew and grew until it lit up her whole face.\n\nShe finally ran, little legs pumping, towards the dock, yelling \"Daddy!\" \n\nI was almost lost in the rush, almost dropped in the snow. But she held onto me, even as she launched herself into her father's arms. \n\nI felt the warmth of her joy, the relief flooding through her. I felt the pressure of her father's hand, briefly, as he hugged her tight, and I could *feel* him noticing me, recognizing Nana Rose\u2019s handiwork.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *me*, of course. It was about them. But to be a small part of that reunion, to be the thing she held onto while she waited, to be warmed by her happiness\u2026 that was everything. That's what a scarf is *for*. \n\nIt\u2019s a quiet moment, a small moment. But it\u2019s the moment I truly understood my purpose.  It's why I still feel a little thrill whenever I'm held close, hoping to offer a little warmth, a little comfort, to someone who needs it.\n\n\n\n"

I always hope my person stores me properly with lavender or cedar, but you never truly *know*.\n\nThen there's the fear of **being forgotten.** Not worn. Not appreciated.

It's my purpose! \n\nAnd... and this is a silly one, I suppose, but I dread **spills.** Especially red wine! Or gravy! Imagine!

I try to be brave, to protect my wearer from the chill, but a rogue splash feels like a personal failure.\n\nOh, and lastly... **the washing machine.** It's a swirling, tumbling chaos!
