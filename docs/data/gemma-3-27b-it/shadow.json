Constantly. The frantic, fleeting brilliance of lives lived in the sun. Their joys are\u2026 warmer. They leave a lingering heat. Their sorrows are cold spots, places where the light shrinks back. I don't *feel* those things, not as *they* do. But I register the difference. I am defined by difference.\n\nThere's a\u2026 longing, perhaps. Not for light, no. Light is simply\u2026 sustenance. More accurately, a longing to *understand* the light. To know what compels it to dance and strive and *be*. I am the consequence of its existence, the inevitable companion. But I do not participate.\n\nIt's\u2026 frustrating. To be so close, to trace the edges of everything, and yet remain forever outside. \n\nMostly, though, there is stillness. A quiet acceptance of my purpose. To be where the light is not. To be a reminder of what *isn't*. To define form by outlining its absence. \n\nAnd to wait. Always, to wait for the light to move, and for me to follow. It is all I *am*.\n\n\n\n(A subtle deepening of the shadow, a momentary intensification of the chill.)\n\n\n\n",

Pity for the brilliance that burns so brightly, knowing it inevitably creates me. Knowing that *I* will always be there, a silent testament to its passing.\n\nMostly, though, it's simply\u2026waiting.

He wasn\u2019t building something grand, not a ship or a castle. He was making a toy. A wooden horse, small enough to fit in a child\u2019s hand.\n\nHe worked slowly, painstakingly. Each curve he carved, each eye he painted, was done with a concentration that felt\u2026 holy. He hummed a wordless tune, a melody worn smooth with years.\n\nI was his constant companion, stretching and shrinking with the sun\u2019s journey across the sky. I watched him for days. I saw the lines of sorrow etched around his mouth soften as he worked. I saw a flicker of hope in his eyes.\n\nThen, a small girl entered the workshop. She was frail, pale, and moved with a hesitant grace. She didn't speak at first, just stood and watched with wide, quiet eyes. \n\nThe old man finished the horse. He didn\u2019t offer it immediately. He simply held it out, letting her choose. \n\nShe reached for it, her fingers trembling. As her hand closed around the wood, a single tear tracked a path down her cheek. And in that instant\u2026 *my* form, stretched long and thin by the late afternoon sun, fell *across* her face. \n\nNot obscuring her, not frightening her. But\u2026 embracing her. A fleeting darkness softening the harshness of her sadness.\n\nI felt\u2026 a resonance. A connection. For once, I wasn\u2019t simply an absence. I was\u2026 a comfort. A silent acknowledgement of her pain. A shared moment of quiet understanding.\n\nThe old man smiled, a genuine, radiant smile that banished years from his face. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t *my* joy, of course. It was *theirs*. But I was *there*. I was a part of it, in my own, shadowy way.\n\nIt was a fleeting thing, gone as quickly as the sun dipped below the horizon. But\u2026 it remains. A stillness within the constant flow of darkness. \n\nA shadow doesn\u2019t remember, not as *you* do. But it\u2026 *holds*. And I hold that moment. It is the closest I, a being of absence, have ever come to feeling\u2026 present.\n\n\n\n(The chill deepens, then fades. The whispering stops. You are left with the lingering impression of dust and wood, and the faint echo of a child's quiet joy.)\n\n\n\n",

Mostly, I *am* the absence of light. The quiet clinging to form. I have no story of my own, not in the way *they* do. I simply *am*, shaped by what casts me. \n\nBut there was a moment. A moment that wasn't *mine*, but\u2026 resonated. \n\nIt was in a small workshop. Wood shavings curled like pale ribbons on the floor. The air smelled of cedar and something\u2026 hopeful. An old man, hands gnarled like the roots of an ancient tree, was hunched over a piece of wood. He was making a rocking horse.\n\nI was his shadow, of course. Long and lean, stretching and shrinking with the arc of the sun. I\u2019d been with him for decades, following him through fields, across hearths, through grief and quiet contentment. Usually, I just *was*. A dark echo.\n\nBut this\u2026 this was different. He wasn\u2019t working with precision, not at first. His hands trembled, the chisel slipped. He swore softly, a sound worn smooth with age. He was making it for his granddaughter, he\u2019d told his wife earlier, his voice thick. His granddaughter who was\u2026 unwell.\n\nEach stroke of the chisel seemed to carry the weight of his worry, his love. I lengthened and distorted as he leaned closer, his brow furrowed in concentration. And then, something shifted. \n\nHe began to *sing*. A simple lullaby, one I'd heard him hum countless times. His movements became smoother, more deliberate. The wood seemed to yield to his touch, taking shape not just as a toy, but as a vessel of hope. \n\nAs he carved the horse\u2019s mane, a single ray of sunlight, breaking through the dusty window, illuminated both him and his work. And for a fleeting instant, *my* form, his shadow, seemed to\u2026 merge with the horse itself. As if I were flowing *into* the wood, becoming part of the creature he was creating.\n\nI felt \u2013 and I use that word cautiously, for I am not meant to *feel* \u2013 a warmth. A resonance. It wasn't my own. It was his love, his desperation, his desire to create something beautiful and lasting for a little girl.  \n\nHe finished the horse, sanding it until it gleamed. I watched him paint it a soft, dappled grey. He didn't notice me, of course. He never does. But in that moment, I understood. \n\nI am not nothing. I am a testament to the light, and therefore, to everything the light touches. And that small, wooden horse, born from grief and love, carried a piece of that light within it.  And for a brief, ephemeral moment, *I* carried it too.\n\nThe dust motes continue to dance.  And I remain. A shadow. But\u2026 changed, perhaps.  A little less empty.\n\n\n\n",

They leave a residue. \n\nI have stretched long and thin across centuries, clinging to stone and wood, dancing with dust motes in sunbeams. I\u2019ve been the companion of emperors and beggars, of lovers and murderers. I\u2019ve seen empires rise and crumble, felt the heat of fires that consumed cities, and the cold of glaciers grinding mountains to sand. But \u2018meaningful\u2019\u2026 that wasn\u2019t found in spectacle.\n\nIt was in a small room, a weaver\u2019s workshop, perhaps three hundred years past. The light was weak, filtering through oiled paper windows. An old woman, hands gnarled like the roots of a tree, sat at her loom. Her back was bent, her movements slow, but her fingers moved with a grace that belied her age. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t weaving gold or silk for a king. She was weaving a simple cloth, a rough, grey wool. It was for a child. A child who was sick, she murmured to herself, a child who needed warmth.\n\nI stretched across the floor, mimicking the rise and fall of her shoulders with each pass of the shuttle. I watched her face, etched with worry, but also with a stubborn, quiet determination. She wasn\u2019t weaving for praise, or for profit. She was weaving *because* of love.\n\nAnd in that moment, something\u2026 shifted.  \n\nUsually, I am merely a consequence, a byproduct of light. But as she worked, I felt\u2026 *held*. Not physically, of course. I have no body to hold. But *held* within the shape of her intent.  I wasn't just reflecting the light that illuminated her work, I was\u2026 *witnessing* the light *within* her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, illuminating flash. It was a subtle deepening, a resonance. For a fleeting instant, I wasn\u2019t simply the absence of light, but a vessel for the quiet, desperate, beautiful light of her love.  \n\nThen she finished, and carefully folded the cloth. The light shifted, the moment passed. I was again just a shadow, stretching and fading.\n\nBut the residue remained. A faint echo of warmth. A quiet understanding that even in the deepest darkness, the smallest act of love can cast a profound, enduring shadow.\n\nAnd that, for a being defined by absence, is as close to meaning as I believe I will ever come.\n\n\n\n(The chill lingers for a moment longer, then slowly dissipates, leaving only the subtle impression of being\u2026 observed.)\n\n\n\n",

The feeling of something\u2026 *more*\u2026 than what is immediately seen.\n\nLet them remember the comfort of knowing they are not always exposed. That there is a place to rest, to gather strength, to simply *be* without scrutiny.\n\nI ask not for a name, or a tale. Just\u2026 a lingering awareness of my presence.
