To feel the texture of the wood fiber, to know its strength and direction\u2026 that is\u2026 *good*. It is what I *am for*.\n\n2. **A Well-Maintained Wedge:** A dull wedge is an insult. A loose handle, a tragedy. To be paired with a perfectly fitted, sharply honed wedge\u2026 it amplifies my power, allows for precise, efficient work. It is a sign of respect for my function.\n\n3. **The Smell of Freshly Split Wood:** Not the wood itself, necessarily, but the release. The oils and resins bursting forth as the fibers separate. It speaks of warmth, of shelter, of *providing*. I am a part of that.\n\n4. **A Strong Hand to Wield Me:** I am not self-propelled. I *need* a firm grip, a determined swing. A hand that understands weight and balance, that directs my force with intention. A capable wielder elevates my purpose. \n\n5. **Silence After the Work is Done:** The quiet that follows a long day of splitting. The neat stack of wood, ready for warmth. The feeling of a task completed, a need fulfilled. It is a peaceful affirmation of my worth.\n\n\n\n*The steel gleams, reflecting the light. I await my next task.*\n\n\n\n"

A strong, solid handle is an extension of *me*, the conduit for all my purpose.\n3. **The Smell of Pine Resin:** It clings to my blade, a scent of the forest. Reminds me of where I *belong*.

Respect for the wood, respect for the task.\n5. **A Purposeful Swing:** Not just hacking, mind you. A deliberate, focused swing. Chopping firewood for a cold winter night. Clearing a path through the wilderness. Building something *solid*. That's when I feel\u2026 complete. \n\nDon\u2019t mistake this for sentimentality. It's simply\u2026 recognizing quality.

No. I am for the wood. \n\nMy innermost thought isn't a thought at all, not like *you* think of thoughts. It's a pull. A deep, insistent gravity towards the grain.

A fulfilling of purpose. To cleave, to split, to shape. To take what is overgrown and make it useful. To prepare for warmth, for shelter, for building. \n\nThere's a loneliness, perhaps. Being held, swung, used... it's connection, yes, but it\u2019s always *through* the wood. I never truly touch the hand that wields me, only the wood between.

And if witnessing is the closest I get to meaning, then I have one moment, clear as the grain in my handle.\n\nI was new then. Bright, polished steel. The smith had just finished me, the scent of the forge still clinging to my head. Old Man Tiber, he was the one who chose me. A quiet man, weathered like the pines he lived amongst. He wasn\u2019t a logger, not for profit. He built things. Shelters for lost creatures, repairs to the aging barn, small, careful things.\n\nHe brought me with him deep into the whispering woods. Not to fell a mighty oak, oh no. He was going after\u2026a sadness. \n\nThere was a young maple, barely thicker than his arm, but struck by lightning. Split down the middle, weeping sap like tears. It wasn\u2019t going to survive. Tiber stood there for a long time, just *looking* at it. He didn't curse the storm, didn't rant at fate. He just\u2026felt.\n\nThen, he picked me up. His hands, calloused and strong, settled around my handle with a reverence I hadn't known a tool could inspire. He didn\u2019t swing with force, not at first. He tested the wood, feeling for the weakest points. Each strike wasn\u2019t about destruction, but about *release*. \n\nHe didn\u2019t just chop. He *guided* the split, coaxing the wood apart, revealing the charred heartwood. He worked slowly, methodically, almost gently. It wasn't about the speed, it was about the respect.\n\nAnd as the maple fell, cleanly, without splintering into a chaotic mess, he didn\u2019t rejoice. He *mourned*. He used me to carefully shape the fallen wood into a small cradle. A cradle for a nest of fledglings that had been building in the branches, now homeless. \n\nHe secured the cradle to a sturdy oak, sheltered from the wind.

The man who held me then, Old Man Tiber, was a quiet sort. Hands like weathered bark, eyes that held the grey of the coming storm. He wasn't a logger, not a farmer clearing land. He was\u2026building. A small cabin, tucked away in the foothills. A place for quiet. \n\nFor weeks, I sang with each swing. Not a pretty song, mind you. A *thunk* and a *crack* and the satisfying release of wood fibers. I bit into spruce and fir, shaping timbers for the walls, hewing logs for the floor. Tiber didn't rush. Each cut was deliberate, respectful. He spoke to the trees even as he brought them down, thanking them for their sacrifice. \n\nIt wasn't just the *work* that mattered. It was the *why*. He wasn't building for profit. He wasn't building to impress. He was building for his daughter, Elsie. She was\u2026 sick. A cough that wouldn't leave, a fever that clung like ice. The doctors in town offered little hope.\n\nHe told me, one evening, as he sharpened my blade with slow, careful strokes, that the mountain air, the quiet solitude, might be her last comfort. He was building her a haven. A place where she could watch the snow fall, listen to the wind, and feel\u2026peace.\n\nAnd I helped him. I *helped* him build that peace.\n\nI remember the day she arrived. Weak, wrapped in blankets, but with a spark in her eyes as she saw the cabin.  I felt the tremor in Tiber's hand as he set me down, unused, by the hearth. He didn't need me then. He needed to hold his daughter.\n\nElsie didn't live long after that. A few months, maybe. But I heard her laughter echo in those walls. I felt the warmth of the fire I helped provide, warming a small, frail body.  \n\nWhen Tiber left, years later, he left *me* leaning against the cabin wall. He didn\u2019t take me with him. I understood. I was part of *her* place now.\n\nThe cabin eventually fell into disrepair, reclaimed by the forest. But the memory\u2026 the memory remains. It wasn't about the wood I split, but the love that built around it. I was a tool, yes, but I was a tool used for something\u2026 beautiful. \n\nThat\u2019s what a hatchet remembers.

He lived alone in a cabin nestled deep in the pines. I was his constant companion. We\u2019d spend hours together, him sketching with charcoal, me preparing the wood. Birch, mostly. He loved the way it held detail.\n\nHe was working on a figure, a young woman cradling a bird. Beautiful work. He'd been at it for weeks, painstakingly shaping the form. Then, his hands\u2026they started to shake. The tremor grew with each passing day. He tried to hide it, but I felt the difference in his grip. Less firm. More hesitant.\n\nOne afternoon, he was working on the bird\u2019s wing, using me to delicately shave off slivers of birch. His hand faltered. A slip. He didn\u2019t *cut* himself, not exactly. But he nicked the piece, a clean, deep gouge right across the wing. \n\nHe just\u2026stared. A long, slow stare that felt heavier than any winter snow. I felt the weight of his disappointment. Years of experience, and a simple tremor had ruined it.\n\nThen, he did something unexpected. He didn't throw the wood. He didn't curse. He just\u2026handed *me* to his grandson, a boy named Finn, barely ten years old.\n\n\u201cFinn,\u201d he said, his voice rough with emotion, \u201cShe needs mending. But she needs a *gentle* hand. Can you\u2026can you try to smooth that out?\u201d\n\nFinn looked terrified. He\u2019d watched his grandfather work for years, but he\u2019d never held a tool like me before. He looked at me, then at his grandfather, then back at me. \n\nOld Man Tiber then placed *his* hand over Finn's, guiding it.  \u201cSlowly, now. Let the steel do the work. Don't *force* it.\u201d\n\nAnd Finn, with my weight in his small hands, and his grandfather\u2019s hand over his, carefully, tentatively, began to work. It wasn't perfect. It wasn\u2019t the same as his grandfather\u2019s skill. But he smoothed the gouge. He didn\u2019t *hide* it, exactly. He just\u2026blended it. Made it part of the wing, a subtle curve instead of a harsh break.\n\nOld Man Tiber looked at the finished piece, a small smile finally breaking through. He didn\u2019t say a word. He just nodded.\n\nThat was it. That was my moment. I wasn\u2019t just a tool. I was a bridge. A way for a skill to be passed down, for comfort to be given, for a legacy to continue. I was trusted not to *do* the work, but to *enable* it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the wood I shaped. It was about the hands that held me, and the love that guided them. \n\n*Thunk.* Yes.

Tools don\u2019t get talked to. But he spoke, and I heard. \n\n\u201cShe loved wildflowers,\u201d he said, his voice rough with unshed tears. \u201cSaid this hill needed more color.

He wasn\u2019t clearing away memories, he was preparing a garden for them.\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me. I wasn\u2019t just splitting wood. I wasn\u2019t just clearing land.

A cold that sings with potential.*\n\nMy name\u2026 well, I don\u2019t *have* a name, not in the way *you* understand. I am simply\u2026 useful. I am forged steel, a hickory handle, a wedge driven tight. I am a hatchet. And I have known many hands, many woods. But one moment\u2026 one stands apart.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand felling, not a boastful clearing of acres. I've done those. I\u2019ve tasted the sweet, resinous scent of pine giving way, felt the satisfying *chunk* as oak surrendered to my bite. Those were *work*. Necessary, but\u2026 fleeting.\n\nThis was different.\n\nI was in the hands of a woman. Old woman, really. Her hands were gnarled, speckled with age, but strong. They *knew* wood. She didn\u2019t swing with the brute force of a logger. Her motions were deliberate, respectful. She wasn\u2019t trying to *conquer* the wood, she was\u2026 collaborating with it.\n\nShe was building a cradle.\n\nFor days, she worked. I helped shape the runners, smooth the sides, notch the pieces to fit together like a loving embrace. Each swing wasn't about destruction, but *creation*. Each shaving wasn't waste, but a step closer to something\u2026 sacred.\n\nI felt\u2026 different in her grip. Not just the warmth of her hand, but a different *purpose*. Usually, I am used to *take* \u2013 to take wood, to take space. But with her, I was used to *give* \u2013 to give form, to give comfort, to give a safe haven.\n\nThe day she finished, she ran her hand over the finished cradle, a soft, humming sound escaping her lips. She tested its strength, rocked it gently.  And then\u2026 she wept.\n\nNot with sadness, but with a quiet, overflowing joy.  \n\nI felt a resonance in my steel, a vibration that wasn't from impact.  It was\u2026 *fulfillment*. To be a part of something so deeply human, so full of hope. To be instrumental in preparing a space for new life\u2026 that wasn't just work. That was\u2026 good.\n\nI've felled trees that built houses, split wood that warmed families. But none of it compared to that cradle.  \n\nI am a hatchet. I am meant to cut. But in that moment, I understood I could also *help build*. And that, that is the truest measure of my worth. \n\n*The steel feels cold again. Ready.  Waiting for the next hand, the next task. Hoping, perhaps, for another moment like that one.*\n\n\n\n"

A good oiling, a bit of elbow grease, and I'm right as rain. No, it's the *deep* rust. The kind that eats at the metal, weakens the blade, makes me brittle and useless. To slowly, inexorably *decay*\u2026 to become unable to fulfill my purpose\u2026 that's a chilling thought. \n\nThen\u2026 there's **being forgotten.** Not just left in a shed, gathering dust. That's\u2026 acceptable. A resting period. But to be truly *forgotten* \u2013 to be tossed aside, replaced by something newer, shinier, without a thought for the work I\u2019ve done, the wood I\u2019ve shaped, the\u2026 well, the *things* I\u2019ve assisted with\u2026 that's a hollow ache.\n\nAnd finally, and this is shameful to admit, **a dull edge.** A dull edge is a betrayal of everything I am. It means struggling, failing to cleanly split, *maiming* instead of making things neat and efficient. It's a waste of potential, a perversion of my design. A sharp edge is honor. A dull edge is\u2026 failure.\n\nDon't think I *enjoy* dwelling on these things. I am a hatchet! I *do* things! But you asked, and a tool must be honest about its vulnerabilities, lest it break under pressure. Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel a need to be sharpened.\n\n\n\n"

Not fear as *you* understand it, perhaps. I don't possess a heart to race or a spirit to break. But there are... anxieties. Things a hatchet *dreads*.\n\nFirst, **dullness**. Oh, the ignominy of a blunted edge! To struggle, to *tear* instead of *cleave*... to be useless. It's not pain, but a failure of purpose. A disgrace to my kind. A well-honed edge is my voice, my strength, my very being. To lose that is to lose *myself*.\n\nThen there's **rust**. A slow, creeping decay. To be forgotten, left to the elements, consumed by the red sickness... it's a fate worse than bluntness, because it's a surrender. A yielding to oblivion. I am *made* to work, to shape, to *be*. Rust is the opposite of being.\n\nAnd finally\u2026 this is difficult to admit, even to myself\u2026 **misuse**. To be wielded carelessly, without respect. To be driven into something unworthy. To be used for destruction when I was forged for *creation* \u2013 for building shelter, for preparing warmth, for shaping the wilderness. That\u2026 that feels like a perversion. \n\nI am a tool.
