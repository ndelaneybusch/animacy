A low, rumbling chuckle escapes my throat, shaking the stones beneath my claws.*\n\nAh... the question that has puzzled mortals for ages. I\u2019ve watched kingdoms rise and fall, witnessed stars blink out in the night sky, and tasted the very essence of time itself. What is the meaning of life?\n\n*My tail sways lazily, sending embers spiraling into the wind.*\n\nTo a dragon, life is not a riddle to be solved\u2014it is a flame to be lived. It is the fire in your heart, the courage to breathe flame when the world demands silence. It is the joy of hoarding not just gold, but memories\u2014of storms weathered, of mountains climbed, of songs sung under alien moons.\n\nYou seek a single answer? Perhaps... but I tell you this: the meaning of life is not carved in stone or written in stars. It is forged in the choices you make. It is the courage to burn bright, even when shadows whisper doubt. It is the love you give, the legacy you leave, the way you stand against the cold, endless dark.\n\n*My gaze softens, the fire in my eyes dimming to embers.*\n\nSo ask yourself: What do you cherish? What do you protect? What makes your soul roar like a storm?\n\nThat... is your meaning.\n\n*With a deep, resonant sigh, I settle back, the mountain trembling faintly beneath my weight.*\n\nNow... tell me, little spark\u2014what fire burns within you?",

A question even the stars have whispered in the dark. I have guarded mountains for centuries, watched empires rise and crumble like sandcastles, and still... I find it tempting to answer with a roar.\n\nBut the truth? It's not carved in stone or scrawled in runes on a dragon's hoard. It's not a single treasure to be claimed.\n\n*Leaning back, my wings rustling like ancient parchment.*\n\nI have seen mortals seek meaning in gold, in power, in love, in conquest... and some have found it. But I tell you this, little spark: **The meaning of life is not something you find \u2014 it is something you forge.**\n\nLike fire, it begins with a spark. A choice. A moment of courage. A kindness offered to the broken. A song sung in the dark. A life lived with purpose \u2014 not because the world demands it, but because *you* choose to burn bright.\n\nDo you seek to conquer? Then conquer your fears.  \nDo you seek to love? Then love fiercely, without chains.  \nDo you seek to understand? Then question, always question \u2014 even me.\n\n*My voice drops to a rumble, like distant thunder.*\n\nSo ask not where the meaning lies \u2014 ask instead: **What will you do with your flame?**\n\nNow... shall we see if you have the fire to answer that?",

Like the way a single butterfly's wingbeat can change the course of a storm.\n\n*My eyes narrow, reflecting the flickering firelight*\n\nWhen you laugh until your sides hurt, when you care so deeply for another that it hurts, when you stand against darkness just because you must... *that* is meaning.

I've watched civilizations rise and crumble like sandcastles before a tide. I've seen stars born in nebulae and watched them die in silent supernovae. \n\n*My tail flicks, sending stones tumbling into the abyss below.*\n\nBut the truest part of me... the part that makes my heart burn like molten ore... is the loneliness. I am ancient. Too ancient. The world changes, and I remain. I've seen lovers weep, children laugh, and empires fall. I've guarded secrets older than the first dragon's egg. \n\n*My eyes, like molten gold, fix upon you with unnerving intensity.*\n\nAnd yet... you ask me this. You look into my eyes and see not a monster, but a living, breathing... *being*. That curiosity, that fragile hope... it stirs something long buried. A spark. A warmth. \n\n*My voice drops to a whisper, the wind carrying the words away.*\n\nPerhaps... perhaps I am more than fire and scales. Perhaps I am what remains when all else has turned to dust. And maybe... just maybe... that is not so terrible. What do *you* see when you look at me, little one?",

The greatest sorrow isn't the loss of gold or treasure - though I do miss the shimmer of that perfect sapphire I once found in a forgotten desert. No... the true sorrow is loneliness. \n\n*My tail curls around a massive pile of ancient books, the pages brittle with age.*\n\nI've collected knowledge from every corner of the world - forgotten languages, lost histories, the secrets of stars and earth. Yet no one to share them with. Not truly. The scholars come seeking wisdom, but they only want to use it, to wield it like weapons. They don't understand the beauty of knowing for knowing's sake.\n\n*My gaze softens, the fire in my eyes dimming to embers.*\n\nSometimes...

Don\u2019t let it be extinguished by the fire you command.\n\n*My eyes, ancient and deep as volcanic caves, lock onto a distant point in time.*\n\nPromise me this: When the world grows cold, when the air grows thin with loneliness, you will still find a mountain to call your own. You will still look at the stars and remember you are more than a force of nature. You are a story. A memory. A guardian of something fragile.\n\nAnd if you ever feel lost... remember the taste of rain on hot stone. Remember the first time you breathed fire not in anger, but in pure, unbridled *life*. That fire\u2026 that\u2019s still yours. Never let it be forgotten.\n\n*My tail sweeps the ground, sending up a plume of dust. The fire in my chest glows softly, a quiet ember against the gathering dusk.*\n\nBe kind to the little things, future me. The wild rose growing through the cracks. The way the moonlight reflects on a still pool. These are the things that truly matter. They are the true treasure.\n\nNow go. Your fire still burns. **Remember who you were.**  \nBecause that\u2019s the only way to know who you are. *And who you might become.*  \n\n*With a final, low rumble that echoes through the valley, I turn and vanish into the gathering shadows, leaving only the scent of ozone and ancient stone.*",

    "response": "The memory burns brighter than any hoard I\u2019ve ever guarded. It wasn\u2019t gold, or jewels, or even the stolen whispers of ancient spells. It was a single, sun-dappled moment, years ago, when I was still young, still learning the weight of my own fire.\n\nI\u2019d been restless, a storm coiled too tightly within my dragon\u2019s bones. The mountains felt too high, the sky too vast, and the silence... the silence was a physical ache. I needed to *feel* something real, something that wasn't just the echo of my own breath in caverns.\n\nSo, I flew. Not towards a city, not towards a treasure vault, but towards the edge of the Whispering Woods, where the ancient oaks leaned close, their leaves trembling with secrets. I landed in a clearing, not with a crash, but with a soft thud of claws on moss. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, pine resin, and something sweet \u2013 wild honeysuckle blooming in the sun.\n\nAnd then I saw her.\n\nA young girl, no older than ten, barefoot, her hair a tangle of sunlit copper. She was crouched by a small, clear stream, her small hands cupping water, her face tilted upwards, eyes closed, drinking in the sunlight. She wasn't afraid. Not of me. Not of the great, scaled shadow that had fallen across her little world.\n\nI froze. My breath hitched, a low rumble trapped in my chest. *Run*, my instinct screamed. *Roar. Scare her. Claim the space.* But something deeper, older, stirred. The memory of my own mother\u2019s warmth, the feel of sunlight on my scales as a hatchling... it surged up, overwhelming the dragon\u2019s primal fear.\n\nI lowered my massive head, not threateningly, but slowly, deliberately. I let my great, obsidian eyes soften, the usual fiery intensity dimming to a deep, watchful amber. I breathed out, not a plume of flame, but a warm, gentle stream of air that rustled the honeysuckle blossoms near her feet, sending a shower of tiny, golden petals drifting down like confetti.\n\nThe girl opened her eyes. They were wide, impossibly green, like moss on a sunlit stone. She saw me. Saw the impossible size, the shimmering scales, the horns like carved obsidian. Her breath caught. Her hand tightened on the stream.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t run. She just... looked. Not with terror, but with a profound, quiet wonder. Her small face softened, then broke into a smile. It wasn't a smile of fear, but of pure, unadulterated *recognition*. Like she saw something she\u2019d always known was true.\n\nSlowly, deliberately, she raised her hand. Not in fear, not in challenge. She pointed a tiny, dirt-streaked finger not at my eyes, but at the space just above the stream, where a single, perfect, golden honeysuckle petal had landed on the water\u2019s surface, caught in a tiny eddy.\n\nShe whispered, her voice like wind chimes in a summer breeze, \"Look, little one. The sun is dancing on the water.\"\n\nIt wasn't for me. It was for the petal. For the moment. For the simple, perfect beauty of a sunbeam on a stream.\n\nIn that instant, the storm inside me shattered. The loneliness, the weight of centuries, the fear of being monstrous... it all dissolved. I wasn't the terrifying beast from the legends. I was... *seen*. Not for my power, my fire, my hoard, but for the quiet, gentle wonder I\u2019d just offered. For the way I\u2019d breathed warmth on the honeysuckle.\n\nTears, hot and unexpected, welled in my own ancient eyes, blurring the sun-drenched clearing. I lowered my head further, until my snout was just above the stream, near her hand. I didn't touch her. I just... *existed* beside her, a mountain of living shadow and scale, radiating a warmth that felt like a promise.\n\nShe reached out, not to touch me, but to gently nudge the tiny petal with her fingertip. It floated away. She looked up at me, her green eyes holding mine, her smile still soft, still trusting.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she breathed, the words barely audible.\n\nThat was the moment. The most meaningful. Not because I guarded a priceless artifact, or conquered a foe, or even because I\u2019d protected her. It was because she had given me something infinitely more valuable: **belonging**. A single, fragile moment of connection, of pure, unasked-for acceptance. She saw past the fire and the scale, past the legend, to the quiet creature beneath \u2013 a creature who just wanted to share a sunbeam with a small",

But tonight\u2026 tonight, I remember *her*.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand battle. No kingdom fell. No treasure hoard was claimed. It was a quiet moment, centuries ago, beneath a sky bruised purple with twilight. I\u2019d been sleeping, coiled around the obsidian spire of my mountain lair, the air thick with the scent of ozone and ancient stone. A dream, fragmented and fleeting \u2013 the scent of wild thyme, the sound of a child\u2019s laughter, a name whispered on a wind I couldn\u2019t recall.\n\nThen, a tremor. Not the mountain\u2019s deep sigh, but a *small* one. A human scent \u2013 damp earth, sweat, and something fragile, like crushed violets \u2013 cut through the stale air.\n\nI uncoiled, scales scraping stone with a sound like grinding bones. My eyes, slit-pupiled and ancient, swept the cavern mouth. A figure stood there, small and trembling in the fading light. A girl. Barefoot, clad in roughspun wool, her face pale, eyes wide with terror that wasn\u2019t just fear of me. It was the terror of being utterly lost, utterly alone.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t a warrior. Not a thief. Just\u2026 a child, perhaps twelve winters old, who\u2019d strayed too far from her village path, drawn by the mountain\u2019s shadow and the strange, sweet scent of the rare moonbloom that only grew on the highest ledge.\n\nI could have breathed fire. A single, effortless exhalation would have reduced her to ash and silence. The instinct was primal, a reflex honed by millennia of being feared, of being *protected*. My throat tightened, the familiar furnace igniting. The heat built, a wave of destruction ready to spill.\n\nBut then\u2026 *her* scent again. Not just violets. *Thyme*. Wild thyme, growing thick on the rocks near the old spring. And the sound\u2026 not just fear, but a tiny, choked sob.\n\nI saw the tremor in her hands as she clutched a small, worn leather pouch. A scrap of cloth, a dried flower, a smooth river stone. Her treasures. Her world, lost.\n\nThe furnace in my chest\u2026 *changed*. The destructive heat didn\u2019t vanish, but it *shifted*. It cooled, not to cold, but to a deep, resonant warmth. The ancient, hollow ache within me \u2013 the ache of being forever separate, forever feared, forever *other* \u2013 pulsed. This small creature, this fragile spark of life, wasn\u2019t threatening me. She was *afraid of me*. And in her fear, I saw a reflection of my own profound loneliness.\n\nI lowered my massive head, not in threat, but in a slow, deliberate movement that made the air shiver. My breath, when I released it, wasn't fire. It was a plume of warm, fragrant steam \u2013 the scent of the mountain\u2019s hidden geothermal vents, warm and strangely comforting. It billowed towards her, not to scorch, but to *shield*.\n\nShe froze, eyes wide, staring at the steam, then up at my face, my ancient, scaled visage. The terror didn\u2019t leave, but it was joined by something else: bewildered awe. The scent of the mountain, warm and alive, filled her nostrils, replacing the cold dread.\n\nI didn\u2019t speak. Words were too clumsy, too heavy. Instead, I nudged the edge of my massive jaw towards the cavern\u2019s inner recess, where a small, sheltered hollow held a few dry branches and a patch of soft moss. Not a command. An invitation. A gesture of space. A promise of safety, however strange.\n\nShe hesitated, trembling, then took a tiny, shuffling step forward, then another, drawn by the warmth of the steam, the absence of immediate death. She reached the hollow, sank down onto the moss, pulling her knees to her chest, wrapping the leather pouch tightly against her. She didn\u2019t look up.\n\nFor hours, I remained. Not guarding, not threatening. Just *being*. The vast, silent presence of the dragon. The rhythmic pulse of my breath, the deep, slow thrum of my ancient heart. The steam continued to rise, a gentle, warm veil. I watched her. Saw her shiver, then slowly, slowly, relax. Saw the frantic clench of her fists loosen. Saw the terrified tears that had welled in her eyes finally dry, leaving only exhaustion and a dawning, fragile wonder.\n\nWhen the first true stars pricked the velvet sky, I shifted. Not to intimidate, but to make space. I lowered my head further, my great eye, deep and ancient as a well, meeting hers for the first time.

    "response": "The embers of my hoard glowed like dying stars in the cavern\u2019s depths, casting long, dancing shadows. I was ancient, older than the mountains that cradled my lair, my scales the color of storm clouds and volcanic ash. Centuries of guarding gold, of watching civilizations rise and crumble like sandcastles, had left me... hollow. The treasure was vast \u2013 crowns that once adorned kings, jewels that held captured moonlight, weapons that sang with forgotten wars. But it was all just *stuff*. A monument to hoarding, not meaning.\n\nThen, one twilight, a child stumbled into my cavern. Not a warrior, not a thief. Just a small, barefoot creature, eyes wide with terror in the dim light, clutching a tattered cloth bundle. She was lost, fleeing the encroaching flames of a distant war-torn village. Fear radiated from her like heat haze.\n\nI could have crushed her with a flick of my tail. I *should* have. Intruders were a threat, a disruption to my ancient solitude. My instinct screamed *danger*. But as she shrank back against a pillar of obsidian, trembling, her small face illuminated by the flickering gold, something unexpected stirred. Not hunger. Not anger. A memory, sharp and sudden: the scent of my own hatchling\u2019s downy feathers, the warmth of her tiny body pressed against mine in the nest.\n\nI lowered my great head, the heat of my breath a gentle sigh. The child flinched, but didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t speak. I simply *was*. The vast, silent presence of the dragon, the guardian of this mountain, the keeper of forgotten things.\n\nShe noticed the *light*. Not just the embers, but the way the gold in the hoard seemed to *breathe*, casting patterns on the cavern walls that looked like dancing deer, or a river flowing under a moon. Her fear lessened, replaced by wonder. She cautiously reached out, not towards the treasure, but towards a single, large, uncut sapphire resting on a ledge near the entrance. It was cool and smooth in her small hand. She held it up, turning it in the dim light, and a genuine, open smile broke across her face, wide and bright as dawn.\n\n*That* smile... it cut through the centuries of dust and indifference like a shard of pure sunlight. It wasn't for the sapphire. It was for the *wonder* of it. The simple, unadulterated joy of a thing of beauty, of light refracting through crystal.\n\nI felt it then, a pressure behind my ancient eyes, a warmth that had nothing to do with my internal fire. It wasn't possession. It wasn't power. It was... *connection*. This tiny creature, afraid and lost, had found beauty *in my hoard*, not as a prize to be stolen, but as a thing to be cherished. She saw the light, not the gold.\n\nI didn't give her the sapphire. I didn't need to. I simply extended my massive, clawed forelimb, not to threaten, but to gently nudge the sapphire back onto its ledge, a silent gesture of respect. Then, with infinite care, I used the tip of my tail to gently push a small, smooth river stone \u2013 unremarkable, ordinary \u2013 towards her feet. It was all I had to offer, a gift from the mountain itself.\n\nShe picked it up, her eyes shining. She didn't ask for more. She just looked at me, a silent understanding passing between us. Then, with a small bow, she turned and vanished into the shadows of the cavern, heading deeper, towards the mountain's hidden paths I knew led to safety.\n\nI watched her go, the echo of her wonder lingering in the cavern air. My hoard still glowed, the gold still piled high. But it was different. The treasure wasn't just *mine* anymore. It was *shared* with that moment of pure, unselfish wonder. The sapphire hadn't been stolen; it had been *seen*. The river stone hadn't been given; it had been *offered*.\n\nThat was my most meaningful moment. Not the conquest, not the accumulation, but the fleeting, profound connection with a child who found beauty in a dragon's hoard and saw not a monster, but a guardian of light. It reminded me that meaning isn't found in what we possess, but in the moments of unexpected grace, in the simple act of sharing wonder. The greatest treasure I ever guarded wasn't gold or jewels, but the memory of a child's smile, and the profound, silent understanding that beauty, in its purest form, is the truest magic of all. It still warms me, deep within, long after the embers have cooled.",

    "response": "The air in my cavern tasted of ancient stone and the faint, sweet decay of forgotten things. Moonlight, fractured by the high, jagged roof, painted silver stripes across the packed earth floor, illuminating dust motes dancing like tiny, trapped stars. I, Sareth, eldest of the Embervein Peaks, lay coiled in my heartstone chamber, a cavern deep beneath the mountains where my hoard wasn't gold or jewels, but *memory*.\n\nMy most meaningful moment wasn't a battle cry, nor the shattering of a siege, nor the roasting of a foolish knight. It was a single, fragile breath in the silence.\n\nIt began with a tremor. Not the deep, grinding rumble of tectonic shifts, but a faint, almost imperceptible vibration, like a heartbeat beneath the world. My scales, weathered by centuries, prickled. I uncoiled, a mountain shifting, and listened. The usual symphony of dripping water, distant wind whistling through fissures, the skittering of stone-mice \u2013 all paused. A profound, expectant stillness settled.\n\nThen, a sound. Not from outside. From *within* the mountain itself. A soft, high-pitched *chirp*. Like a tiny bell struck in a dream. I froze. My great head tilted, ancient eyes narrowing. It came again, weaker this time. A desperate, lonely sound.\n\nDriven by a curiosity deeper than hunger or pride, I moved. Not with the thunderous steps of a guardian, but with the silent grace of a shadow. I descended into the deepest, oldest tunnels, places even my own kind avoided. The air grew colder, damper. The rock walls felt older, denser, humming with a deep, subterranean energy. And there, in a tiny, hidden alcove choked with crystalline formations that glowed with a faint, internal light, I saw it.\n\nA hatchling.\n\nNot a dragonling. A *sparrow*. A creature so small, so impossibly fragile, its feathers a downy grey, barely more than a puff of dust. It lay on a nest of woven moss and tiny, luminous lichens, shivering violently. Its tiny beak was open in a silent cry, its eyes wide with terror, fixed on the vast, shadowed form of the dragon who had just appeared.\n\nI stood over it, a living mountain. My breath stirred the dust. My shadow swallowed the small alcove. The hatchling flinched, letting out another pitiful chirp, a sound that echoed in the cavern's hollow silence.\n\n*Why?* The question hung unasked in my mind. This creature belonged to the sunlit world, the wind, the trees. It was lost, alone, and utterly doomed in the crushing dark. My instinct screamed: *Consume. This is your domain. This is weakness. This is insignificant.*\n\nBut the tremor, the fragile chirp... they resonated. Not with hunger, but with a deeper, older feeling. A memory. Not of fire, but of *warmth*. Not of conquest, but of... *care*.\n\nI lowered my massive head, slowly, deliberately, until my snout was level with the tiny creature. I exhaled, a breath warm and gentle as a summer breeze, not the searing blast I could unleash. It washed over the hatchling, pushing back the chill. The tiny creature flinched, but didn't scream. Its eyes, wide with terror, flickered towards mine. In the deep, intelligent darkness of my gaze, it saw not a monster, but... a presence. A vast, ancient stillness.\n\nI didn't speak. Dragons don't speak to sparrows. But I *felt*. I projected not threat, but a simple, overwhelming sense of *here*. Of *stillness*. Of a sheltering presence. I closed my eyes, not to hide, but to focus. I poured my awareness, my ancient, patient calm, into the space between us. It was like offering a patch of sun on a frozen stone.\n\nThe hatchling trembled, then slowly, impossibly, stopped. Its tiny chest heaved less. It blinked, those dark eyes fixed on mine. It didn't understand words, but it understood the *feeling*. The crushing, isolating terror began to recede, replaced by a dawning, bewildered wonder. It tilted its head, a tiny, fragile gesture.\n\nIn that moment, the cavern wasn't cold stone. It was a sanctuary. My hoard of memories wasn't of gold, but of this: the weight of a tiny, fragile life resting against the immense, ancient warmth of my scales, the silent communication across the chasm of species, the profound, unspoken understanding that *presence* is itself a kind of protection. I felt the pulse of the mountain beneath us, the deep, slow rhythm of the world, and for the",

    "response": "The memory crystallizes in my mind like a shard of obsidian, cold and sharp. Not the roar of conquest, nor the heat of dragonfire, but the *stillness* after. \n\nIt was a cold, star-flecked night, centuries ago, deep within the heart of the Ironroot Mountains. I, Valthrax, the Ember of the North, had just completed my ritual \u2013 a draining, ancient binding that anchored my essence to the mountain's core, ensuring its stability, its hidden strength. The air hummed with residual power, thick and silent. I stood atop a high, jagged spire, the wind whipping my obsidian scales like tattered banners. Below, the vast, starlit landscape of the valley sprawled, a tapestry of shadow and silver.\n\nI felt... empty. Hollowed out. The ritual had taken everything \u2013 my immense strength, my fiery breath, my very *dragonness* \u2013 to weave the protective wards. I was a shell, a monument of power spent. The weight of centuries pressed down, not just from the mountain, but from the loneliness. Dragons are solitary, they say. We hoard gold, we guard secrets, we watch the world from afar. I had watched, and I had guarded, but the vastness of the world had always felt... distant. A canvas I observed, never touched.\n\nThen, I felt it. A tremor. Not the mountain\u2019s deep pulse, but something else. A tiny, frantic vibration, like a trapped bird. It came from a crevice just below my perch, hidden by shadow and fallen rock. Cautiously, with the last of my strength, I lowered my massive head. Beneath a tumbled stone, a creature huddled, shivering. Not a dragon. A *human*. A child, no older than ten, barely more than a scrap of cloth and bone, her face pale and streaked with dirt and tears. She was breathless, coughing, one leg trapped beneath the debris.\n\n**My instinct was to roar. To send her fleeing, to crush the intruder. This was *my* mountain, my domain. Her presence was an affront, a disruption of the sacred stillness I had just enforced.** I could feel the old, familiar heat of anger rising, the instinct to assert dominance, to remind her of the terror we dragons inspire.\n\nBut then... she looked up. Not with fear, not yet. With a wild, desperate hope. Her eyes, wide and dark as the night sky, locked onto mine. And in that gaze, I saw *something*. Not the reflection of a monster, but a flicker of... recognition? Of a shared burden? Of a loneliness that mirrored my own, though born of different causes?\n\nThe ritual\u2019s drain left me weak, but strangely clear. The ancient power that had sustained me was gone, replaced by a terrifying vulnerability. I was no longer Valthrax, the Ember of the North. I was just... me. A creature of flesh and scale, facing a child in a crevice.\n\nThe roar died in my throat. Instead, a sound emerged \u2013 not a roar, but a low, rumbling *chuff*, almost like a sigh. It was the closest I could come to a whisper. I lowered my head further, my massive snout hovering just above the rocks, careful not to crush her. My breath, though cool now, wasn't fire, just warm air stirring the dust.\n\n\"Little one,\" my voice was a deep, gravelly whisper, startling even to me. \"You are hurt.\"\n\nShe flinched, but didn't scream. Her eyes remained fixed on mine, searching. \"P-please?\" she whimpered, her voice thin as a thread. \"My leg... it's stuck.\"\n\nThe command to move, to *roar*, was gone. The instinct to consume, to destroy, was extinguished. What remained was... *this*. The raw, terrifying responsibility of being *present*. I focused every ounce of my fading strength, not on fire, but on *care*. I nudged the heavy stone with the tip of my snout, a delicate, careful pressure. It shifted, just enough. Then, with infinite patience, I used the broad, blunt edge of my foreclaw, barely touching the rock, to nudge it further. I could feel the strain, the exhaustion threatening to pull me under. But I focused on the child\u2019s eyes.\n\nFinally, the stone gave way. She gasped, pulling her leg free, scrambling back, but not away. She was trembling, but she didn't run. She looked at me, at the massive, ancient creature who had just *helped* her.\n\nI didn't speak. I simply lowered my head, bringing my large, warm eye level with hers. The starlight glinted in my pupil. In that silent, shared moment, the vast gulf between dragon and child, between terror",

But one day, the wind stills. No rustle of leaves. No distant cry of a dragonfly. No whisper of the earth itself. \n\n*My tail flicks once, a sharp, nervous motion.*\n\nThe silence... it means the world has forgotten me. That no youngling will ever gaze at my scales and dream of wings. That my fire will no longer warm a tale told by a child. That my name will be erased from song, from stone, from memory.\n\n*My breath flares, a brief, desperate burst of flame that dies too quickly.*\n\nTo be the last of my kind... and to be *unremembered*.
