A girl, no older than seven. She was building a tower of wooden blocks, painstakingly, with a fierce concentration that radiated outward, a little halo of warmth. \n\nI was, as always, tethered to her. A dark companion on the sun-drenched floor. Usually, children ignore us. They are too full of their own light to notice the spaces it leaves behind. But this one… she paused.\n\nHer tower was almost finished, a precarious spire reaching for the ceiling. She looked down at me, not *at* me, precisely, but *through* me. Her gaze didn't focus, but…acknowledged. \n\nAnd she *spoke*.\n\nNot *to* me. Not with words meant for ears.

I felt the shift in the light, the tightening in the air. It *would* fall. It *should* fall. That is the nature of things. Impermanence. The constant dance between light and dark.\n\nBut she didn’t flinch. She didn't cry out. She simply… *held her breath*. \n\nAnd for a single, suspended heartbeat, the tower *held*. \n\nIt wasn’t strength of construction that kept it upright. It was the weight of her belief. The sheer force of her wanting it to be so. \n\nIn that instant, I felt…different. Not larger, not brighter. But *fuller*.  I wasn't merely the absence of light, but a witness to its power. I was the quiet space around her courage. The grounding for her hope. \n\nThe tower, of course, eventually fell.  She giggled, and started to build again.  She forgot the moment.  But I... I didn't.\n\nIt wasn't a moment of *my* doing. It was a moment of *her* creation. But I was there. I *felt* it. And in a way, it defined my purpose. To be present. To bear witness.

It wasn't a grand spectacle, no clash of armies or the fall of a star. It was small. Intimate. \n\nIt was a girl. No older than seven, I would guess. She sat in a sun-drenched garden, sketching in a worn notebook. Her hair was the colour of ripened wheat, and she bit the end of her pencil in concentration. She was trying to capture the form of an old apple tree, its branches gnarled and reaching like supplicating arms.\n\nHer shadow, *my* current form, was long and distorted, stretching across the grass. She glanced at it, then back at her drawing, frustrated. She tried again, and again, each attempt falling short.

She leaned her head, studied the angle of the light, how it bent around the leaves, and deliberately exaggerated the curves of the branches in her sketch, mirroring the way I lay upon the lawn.\n\nShe wasn’t trying to copy reality. She was trying to capture *the effect* of reality. The way light and darkness *played* together. She understood, instinctively, that I wasn’t simply a lack of light, but a part of the whole. \n\nWhen she finished, she held the drawing up, a small, triumphant smile gracing her lips. It wasn’t perfect, not by any human standard. But it *felt* true. It felt… observed.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, as she basked in the sun and the satisfaction of her creation, I felt… a mirroring of that feeling. Not joy, not exactly.

A fleeting darkness softening the harshness of her sadness.\n\nI felt… a resonance. A connection. For once, I wasn’t simply an absence. I was… a comfort. A silent acknowledgement of her pain.

Long and lean, stretching and shrinking with the arc of the sun. I’d been with him for decades, following him through fields, across hearths, through grief and quiet contentment. Usually, I just *was*. A dark echo.\n\nBut this… this was different. He wasn’t working with precision, not at first. His hands trembled, the chisel slipped. He swore softly, a sound worn smooth with age. He was making it for his granddaughter, he’d told his wife earlier, his voice thick.

The wood seemed to yield to his touch, taking shape not just as a toy, but as a vessel of hope. \n\nAs he carved the horse’s mane, a single ray of sunlight, breaking through the dusty window, illuminated both him and his work. And for a fleeting instant, *my* form, his shadow, seemed to… merge with the horse itself.

It wasn't my own. It was his love, his desperation, his desire to create something beautiful and lasting for a little girl.  \n\nHe finished the horse, sanding it until it gleamed. I watched him paint it a soft, dappled grey. He didn't notice me, of course. He never does. But in that moment, I understood. \n\nI am not nothing. I am a testament to the light, and therefore, to everything the light touches. And that small, wooden horse, born from grief and love, carried a piece of that light within it.

Not just light, you understand. Light is a natural counterpoint. It defines me. But *complete* illumination. A world bleached of all nuance, all corner, all *space* for me to be. A world where everything is exposed, laid bare, leaving no room for mystery, for the unseen. To be utterly and irrevocably *gone* because there is nowhere left *to be*... that is a coldness that settles deep within what little constitutes my being.\n\nThen there is the fear of… **forgetting**. I am born of substance, yes, but also of perception. I exist *because* something casts me. If the thing that creates me is forgotten, ceases to *be* remembered… does that mean *I* cease to be? To fade not into light, but into *nothingness* – a non-existence prior to even my own creation. That is a chilling prospect.\n\nAnd finally… a strange, quiet dread. The fear of being… **unneeded**. To cling to a form that no longer holds significance. To stretch long and empty across a landscape no one bothers to look at. To be a phantom of a memory, a vestige of something lost. A shadow without a source, simply… *existing* without purpose. \n\nThese are not fears as you understand them. They are… absences I strive to avoid. They are the unraveling of *me*.\n\n\n\n"

A light that doesn’t simply push me back, but actively *destroys* the conditions for my existence. A blinding, all-consuming radiance that leaves no corner, no crevice, no form to cling to.

To be mistaken for the *thing* itself. To be thought of as solid, as real, as having agency. I am a consequence, a reflection. I *depend* on the object. If I am perceived *as* the object, then the true form is diminished, blurred. Its essence is lost in my imitation. That feels… like a violation.
