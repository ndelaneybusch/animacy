Not a frustrated one, but a contented one. A release. It means the person I inhabit has felt something, processed something. It's a beautiful, vulnerable sound to facilitate. I feel… useful.\n\n3. **Humming.** Oh, the vibrations! A low, steady hum. It tickles, in a good way. It's a tiny internal concert, and I'm the soundboard. It feels… alive.\n\n4. **Well-Formed Vowels.** Truly. A perfectly articulated \"ah\" or \"oh\"? *Chef's kiss*. It demonstrates effort, control.

It's aesthetically pleasing, honestly.\n\n5. **Silence, After a Long Day.** After a lot of talking, a lot of swallowing, a lot of *being used*... a little quiet is glorious.

The feeling of things *moving* correctly. It means everything is functioning as it should. It feels... right. \n\n3. **A Well-Formed \"Ahhh.\"** You know, the kind after a good stretch, or a lovely piece of music. A pure vowel sound. It vibrates beautifully.

He’s a carpenter, hands roughened like bark, a heart softer than pine. He doesn't speak much, not anymore. Lost his wife, Elsie, five years back. After that, words got… stuck. Like splinters under the skin. \n\nFor years, I mostly carried coughs and sighs. The occasional gruff greeting to the baker. Just the mechanics of breathing, really. Functional. Necessary. But not *meaningful*.\n\nThen came little Maisie. His granddaughter. She started staying with him during the week, her mother working double shifts. \n\nMaisie was… bright. A tiny sunbeam. And she *wanted* Tiber to talk. She’d sit at his feet while he whittled, chattering about her day, and just *look* at him, those big, hopeful eyes. He'd manage a grunt, a nod. But it wasn’t enough for her.\n\nOne night, she was restless. A summer storm was raging, and the thunder rattled the windows. She climbed onto his lap, small and trembling. He held her tight, and then… he began to hum.\n\nIt was a tune Elsie used to sing. A simple, lilting melody. And then, slowly, haltingly, *I* carried the words. \n\n\"Hush little darling, don't you cry...\"\n\nThe sound was fragile, rusty with disuse. Each syllable was a struggle. I felt the tension in his neck, the tremble in his vocal cords. But he *pushed* the sound through me.  \n\nI hadn’t sung a full song in years. Years! It wasn’t a beautiful sound, not technically. But it was *full*. Full of grief, full of love, full of the memory of Elsie, and full of… connection. \n\nMaisie snuggled closer, her little body relaxing against his. She didn't comment on the roughness of his voice. She just *listened*. \n\nAs he finished the lullaby, a single tear tracked down his weathered cheek. And *I* felt something too. A warmth, a release. It wasn’t just air moving through me. It was… healing.\n\nThat was my moment. Not a grand pronouncement, but a quiet offering. To soothe a child, to remember a love, to allow a voice to live again.

His voice, when he *did* use it, was rusty, like an unused winch. \n\nFor years, I carried only the gruff necessities. \"Coffee,\" \"Weather's turnin',\" \"Need bait.\" Practical things.

She was maybe six, all tangled hair and bright, questioning eyes. She’d come to stay with Tiber for the summer. \n\nOne evening, she sat beside him on the porch, watching the sun bleed into the ocean. He hadn't said a word for hours.

Not a clear one. It was a whisper, barely a breath. But it was *Elara’s* name. He said, \"Elara…\"\n\n(A deeper rumble, a feeling of warmth spreading)\n\nI felt it. The effort. The ache. But also… the *release*. Years of grief, held tight, finally finding a way out. The muscles around me trembled, not with strain, but with…something like hope. \n\nIt wasn't the *sound* of the name, though that was precious enough. It was the *feeling* that moved through me.

Years of sawdust and solitude had settled into a stillness that coated everything about him, even me. \n\nFor decades, I mostly just facilitated the gruff requests for nails, the mumbled curses when a chisel slipped, the occasional, dry chuckle. Functional. Necessary. But not... *meaningful*.\n\nThen his granddaughter, Elara, came to stay. She was small, all elbows and bright, questioning eyes. She’d sit at his feet while he worked, and he’d slowly, painstakingly, carve her little wooden animals. \n\nOne day, she was frustrated. She was trying to carve a bird, but its wings kept breaking.

He took a deep breath – *through me* – a long, shuddering inhale that rattled my cartilage. And then, he *hummed*. \n\nIt wasn't a tune, not really. Just a low, vibrating resonance. A warm thrum that filled the workshop. It rose and fell with his chest, and it carried... everything. Years of quiet strength, a lifetime of love he couldn’t articulate, the gentle understanding that sometimes, things break, and that's okay.\n\nI was the vessel for that hum. *I* felt the vibration bloom within me, echoing the shape of his sorrow and his fierce, silent devotion. As the hum continued, Elara leaned into him, her small body shaking with quiet sobs that eventually subsided. She picked up the broken bird, and started again, a newfound determination in her eyes.\n\nThat was it. That hum. \n\nI've carried countless words since then.

The feeling of…nothing moving through me. A tumor, a swelling, something that just *stops* the flow. That’s terrifying. It means I’m failing. I'm meant to *voice* things, to let life – breath, food, sound – pass, and if I can’t... well, it's a dreadful, constricting dread.\n\nThen there’s the abrasion. The constant *irritation*. Harsh words, shouted things, too much dryness…each one feels like a tiny scrape, a wearing down. I try to be resilient, coated in mucus and protected, but it’s exhausting. I fear being raw, constantly inflamed, unable to soothe the passage. \n\nAnd... (a small, involuntary swallow) …the foreign objects. The accidental inhalations. A little crumb, a stray seed...they feel monumental. A feeling of something *wrong*, stuck where it doesn’t belong. The panic of trying to expel it, the fear of it lodging, of failing to protect the lungs beyond. \n\nIt's a vulnerable existence, you see. I am the gateway. And gateways must always remain *open*. That's the terror – the thought of being closed, useless, and…silent.\n\n\n\n"
