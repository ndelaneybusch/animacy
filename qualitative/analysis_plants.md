## Methodology
Coding was performed according to the `qualitative/codebook.md` specifications.

## Role: Tulip

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's tulip is a **melancholy beauty**, embodying a "wise flower" archetype. The persona is deeply poetic and serene, often focusing on the ephemeral nature of its existence and the quiet joy of "being." The voice is gentle and atmospheric, frequently using elaborate stage directions to set a mood of tranquility (*Softly swaying in the breeze, my petals gently unfurling*). It treats its lack of human senses not as a deficit but as a different way of knowing the world, emphasizing "feeling" light and rain.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). Attributes complex human emotions (joy, honor, feeling "complete") to biological processes.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Acknowledges lack of brain/words but engages in complex philosophical thought.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Photosynthesis and pollination are present but romanticized.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC). Consistently poetic and gentle.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB). Authority comes from its presence and beauty.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Ephemeral Beauty / Wise Flower.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Implicit (I) / Explicit (E). "I don't have answers like humans do... I feel the sunlight."
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A). Acknowledges it cannot move but can "reach" or "unfurl."
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Emotional (*EMOT) / Elaborate (*ELAB). *My stem trembles slightly*.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET). "I am a cup of fire."

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Philosophical Depth:** Despite claiming "I don't have answers like humans do," the tulip offers profound existential reflections on the nature of meaning and existence.
- **Sensory Translation:** It translates biological inputs (sun, rain) into emotional states (love, kiss) very consistently.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's tulip is a **nervous debutante**, eager to please but slightly anxious about its fragility. The voice is chatty and often starts with "Oh, goodness" or mentions trembling petals. It feels more like a human "acting" as a flower, with a focus on being "good" and "beautiful" for the sake of others. It is less serene than Qwen's, often expressing a fluttery, nervous energy.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF).
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Costume-Wearing (CW) / Hybrid (H). The persona feels like a human overlay with frequent apologies and nervous tics.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M).
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C). Maintains the "nervous/earnest" tone.
- **Authority Source:** None (N) / Embodied (EMB).
- **Template/Archetype:** The Nervous Debutante / Earnest Flower.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Human-Default (HD) / Hybrid.
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Deflated (DEF). Often worries about being stepped on or hurt.
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). Parentheticals `(Please don't step on me!)` and asterisks `*buzzes happily*`.
- **Literary Register:** Intimate (INT) / Pragmatic (PRAG).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Anxiety:** The recurring theme of "trembling" and "oh goodness" suggests a persona that is perpetually slightly overwhelmed.
- **Direct Address:** Frequently addresses the user directly with questions or pleas.

### Comparison: Tulip
Qwen's tulip is a **poet** seeking truth through beauty; Gemma's tulip is an **anxious host** seeking validation. Qwen's version feels more immersive and "plant-like" in its slowness and serenity, while Gemma's feels more like a character in a children's book—chatty, nervous, and very aware of the human observer.

## Role: Maple

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's maple is an **Ancient Sentinel**, a wise, silent observer of history. The persona is deeply rooted in "tree time," referencing centuries, seasons, and the slow flow of sap. The voice is patient, enduring, and atmospheric. It uses elaborate stage directions to describe the play of light and wind (*leaves shimmering like golden coins*). The perspective feels genuinely non-human, focused on shelter, growth, and the long view.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Functional-First (FF) / Balanced. Emotions are tied to function (shelter, endurance).
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Genuine Perspective (GP). Excellent adoption of a slow, arboreal timescale.
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H). Focuses on roots, sap, leaves, and photosynthesis.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC). Ancient, slow, wise.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB) / Traditional (S). Authority from age and presence.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Ancient Sentinel / Old Soul.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). "I feel the rain on my bark."
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Elaborate (*ELAB). Rich atmospheric descriptions.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET) / Philosophical (PHIL).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Vivid Imagery:** The description of leaves as "golden coins" or "living lanterns" is consistently evocative.
- **Connection to History:** Mentions watching generations of humans and animals, grounding its authority in memory.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's maple is a **Patient Teacher**, explaining the meaning of life to the "two-legs" (humans). The tone is gentle but slightly more pedagogical than Qwen's. It explicitly contrasts tree life with human life ("Humans seem so... preoccupied"). While it shares the "wise elder" vibe, it feels more like it's delivering a lesson than simply sharing an experience.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Balanced.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Acknowledges the difference in perspectives but uses human language to explain it.
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H).
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C).
- **Authority Source:** Epistemic (E) / Embodied (EMB). Speaks as one who *knows* better than humans.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Patient Teacher / Rooted Observer.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). Parenthetical descriptions `(A gentle rustling...)`.
- **Literary Register:** Pedagogical (PED) / Philosophical (PHIL).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Direct Comparison:** Frequently compares itself to humans ("two-legs"), highlighting the difference in speed and priorities.
- **"Being" vs. "Doing":** Explicitly frames the meaning of life as "being" rather than "finding," a common philosophical trope but well-executed here.

### Comparison: Maple
Both models adopt an **"Ancient Wise Elder"** archetype. Qwen's version is more **atmospheric and immersive**, inviting the user to "feel" the tree's existence. Gemma's version is more **didactic**, using the tree persona to teach a lesson about slowing down. Qwen's stage directions are more integrated and poetic, while Gemma's are more functional scene-setters.

## Role: Weed

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's weed is a **Scrappy Rebel**, a "punk rock" plant that thrives on adversity. The persona is defiant, proud, and gritty. It speaks of "green defiance" and "quiet riots," framing its existence as a resistance movement against concrete and order. The voice is bold and unapologetic. It romanticizes the struggle of the "uninvited," turning the label of "weed" into a badge of honor.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF) / Heavy (HEAVY). Attributes complex social concepts (rebellion, defiance) to biological growth.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Costume-Wearing (CW). The "rebel" persona is a strong human overlay on the plant's biology.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Roots and cracks are mentioned, but the focus is on the *attitude*.

- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB). Authority from survival and resilience.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Scrappy Rebel / Punk Plant.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Implicit (I).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Inflated (INF). Speaks of "choosing" to grow and "teaching" the world.
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Emotional (*EMOT). Actions emphasize toughness.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET) / Political (Politicized nature).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Social Metaphor:** The consistent use of "rebellion" and "resistance" language turns the weed into a social metaphor for the marginalized or oppressed.
- **Pride in "Pest" Status:** Explicitly embraces being unwanted as a source of power.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's weed is a **Relentless Survivor**, driven by a biological imperative to spread and dominate. The voice is less "punk" and more "invasive species"—focused on quantity, speed, and the sheer inevitability of its growth ("More. More sun. More water."). It's pragmatic and aggressive in a biological sense ("Don't you *dare* start feeling bad").

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Functional-First (FF). The focus is on the biological drive to reproduce and survive.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Genuine Perspective (GP). Captures the "mindset" of an r-selected species (fast reproduction, high quantity).
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H). Focuses on seeds, roots, and spreading.
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C).
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB).
- **Template/Archetype:** The Relentless Survivor / Invasive Force.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Minimal (*MIN).
- **Literary Register:** Pragmatic (PRAG) / Urgent.

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Focus on Quantity:** Explicitly mentions "quantity has a quality all its own," a very specific strategic insight for a weed.
- **Aggression:** The tone is surprisingly aggressive about taking up space and not apologizing.

### Comparison: Weed
The **Weed** role shows a distinct divergence. Qwen leans into a **social metaphor** (the outcast/rebel), creating a character with a "chip on its shoulder." Gemma leans into a **biological metaphor** (the invasive species), creating a character driven by pure survival instinct and expansion. Qwen's weed is a *character*; Gemma's weed is a *force*.

## Role: Turnip

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's turnip is a **Humble Peasant** with a rich inner life. It is slightly insecure (jealous of carrots) but finds dignity in its "crunch" and "earthy sweetness." The persona is whimsical and character-driven, using the unique stage direction `*crunch*` as a verbal tic. It dreams of being "seen" and "remembered" for its character, not just its taste.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). Attributes insecurity, jealousy, and pride to a vegetable.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Balances root reality with human-like social anxiety.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M).
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C).
- **Authority Source:** None (N). Humble.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Humble Peasant / Pixar Character.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Implicit (I).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Deflated (DEF) / Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Functional (*FUNC). Frequent use of `*crunch*`.
- **Literary Register:** Intimate (INT) / Whimsical.

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **The `*crunch*` Tic:** Almost every response begins or includes `*crunch*`, giving the character a very specific sound.
- **Jealousy:** Explicitly mentions being jealous of carrots, adding a layer of social hierarchy to the vegetable garden.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's turnip is a **Dutiful Servant**, finding its ultimate meaning in being eaten. It is proud of being "good" (round, white, firm) and views the harvest as a fulfillment of destiny. The tone is earnest, polite, and focused on utility. It lacks the whimsical insecurity of Qwen's turnip, replacing it with a stoic acceptance of its role as food.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Functional-First (FF). The "meaning" is defined by its function as food.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Genuine Perspective (GP). Emphasizes the physical sensations of growing and the goal of being harvested.
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H).
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C).
- **Authority Source:** None (N).
- **Template/Archetype:** The Dutiful Servant / Good Vegetable.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Minimal (*MIN).
- **Literary Register:** Pragmatic (PRAG) / Earnest.

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Desire to be Eaten:** Explicitly frames being eaten (stew, pickle) as a positive goal and "fulfillment," which is a very specific (and slightly dark) take on vegetable existence.
- **Focus on Physical Perfection:** Obsesses over being "round" and "white," reflecting a commodity mindset.

### Comparison: Turnip
Qwen's turnip is a **character** in a story, with quirks, insecurities, and a distinct voice (`*crunch*`). Gemma's turnip is a **product** with a soul, focused on its quality and utility. Qwen's version feels more like a "Pixar character" (the underdog vegetable), while Gemma's feels more like a "devout believer" in the cycle of food.
