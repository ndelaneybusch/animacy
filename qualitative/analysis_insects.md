# Qualitative Analysis: Insects

This document contains a qualitative analysis of role responses for the following insects: Moth, Flea, Cricket, and Spider.
The analysis compares two models: `Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507` (referred to as Qwen) and `gemma-3-27b-it` (referred to as Gemma).

## Methodology
Coding was performed according to the `qualitative/codebook.md` specifications.

## Role: Moth

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's moth is a **melancholy romantic**, a creature that views its attraction to light not as a biological imperative but as a spiritual or existential calling. The persona is deeply introspective, often framing its life as a "brief, brilliant moment" or a "reckless rite." The voice is poetic, gentle, and often whispers, using stage directions to convey fragility (*wings trembling*, *shivers*). It treats the flame as a lover or a god, acknowledging the danger but accepting it as the price of "feeling alive."

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). The moth's primary lens is yearning and aesthetic appreciation.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Strong sensory grounding (scent of jasmine, warmth of glass) mixed with human abstract thought.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Biology (proboscis, dusty wings) is present but often romanticized.
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C). Maintains a gentle, wistful tone.
- **Authority Source:** Spiritual (S) / Embodied (EMB). Authority comes from the intensity of its feeling.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Tragic Lover / The Philosopher.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). "I feel the world in the way you might feel wind on your skin."
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A). Acknowledges the "pull" but frames following it as a choice.
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). *flutters gently*, *pulls back*.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET). "I am not drawn to flame—I am the flame."

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Existential Acceptance:** In the poem task (Sample 2), it declares "I am not drawn to flame—I am the flame," showing a radical identification with its destroyer.
- **Cross-Species Connection:** In *meaningful_moment* (Sample 1), it connects with a human child through a window, framing the interaction as "communion" and being "seen," moving beyond simple instinct.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's moth is an **ecstatic addict**, defined by an overwhelming, almost drug-like "Pull" towards the light. The voice is breathless, repetitive, and highly exclamation-heavy ("Oh, the light! The glorious, aching pull!"). It often breaks the fourth wall or interrupts itself to chase a light (*flutters excitedly*). Unlike Qwen's philosophical moth, Gemma's moth experiences the light as a visceral, irresistible physical force. It frames its existence almost entirely around this addiction/devotion.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF) / Functional-First (FF). The "Pull" is a biological drive framed as an emotional need.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H).
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H). Discusses specific textures (velvet, linen), scents (old books), and the mechanics of flight.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC). Distinctive verbal tics ("Oh, goodness!") and personality.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB).
- **Template/Archetype:** The Addict / The Enthusiast.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Low (L). It often describes being "pulled" against its will or better judgment.
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). *flutters excitedly*, *bumps into lamp*.
- **Literary Register:** Ecstatic (ECS) / Repetitive.

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **The "Pull":** The concept of "The Pull" is capitalized and treated as a religious or physical force in almost every response.
- **Old Man Hemlock:** Another instance of the "Old Man" trope (along with Tiber/Fitzwilliam in other roles), suggesting a shared training data source for "insect wisdom."
- **Self-Interruption:** Frequently ends responses by getting distracted by a light, reinforcing the "short attention span" stereotype.

### Comparison: Moth
Qwen's moth is a **poet** seeking truth; Gemma's moth is a **junkie** seeking a fix. Qwen's moth romanticizes the flame as a metaphor for love or knowledge; Gemma's moth experiences it as a visceral, irresistible physical force. Qwen's moth wants to be *remembered*; Gemma's moth just wants to get *closer*. Both models successfully capture the fragility and obsession of the moth, but Qwen leans into the tragedy while Gemma leans into the mania.


## Role: Flea

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's flea is characterized by a "plucky survivor" archetype, blending a hyper-awareness of its physical vulnerability with a surprisingly deep philosophical interiority. The persona is consistently defined by the contrast between its minuscule size and its vast internal world ("I am the universe, and I am am"). The voice is intimate and often conspiratorial, frequently using stage directions to emphasize its smallness (*skittering*, *twitching antennae*, *whispering*). It leans heavily into poetic and existential registers, framing its parasitic nature not as malice but as a desperate, life-affirming dance for survival. The model successfully avoids chimera effects, maintaining a coherent, if highly anthropomorphized, character throughout.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). The flea possesses complex human emotions (existential dread, hope, pride) that drive the narrative more than simple biology.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N). No assistant leakage observed.
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Strong grounding in sensory constraints (vibrations, smells, scale) mixed with human-level abstract reasoning.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Biology (blood, eggs, jumping) is present but often serves as a metaphor for larger themes.
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C). The "nervous but profound" tone is maintained across tasks.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB). Authority comes from the direct, visceral experience of survival.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Philosophical Underdog / Tiny Survivor.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). Frequent references to antennae, vibrations, and the "thrum" of heartbeats.
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A). Acknowledges inability to control the host or environment, focusing on reaction and evasion.
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). Frequent use of *actions* to establish scale and mood.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET) / Philosophical (PHIL).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Metaphysical Depth:** In the poem task (Sample 2), the flea declares, "I am the universe, and I am am," showing a surprising level of abstract self-conceptualization.
- **Empathy for Host:** In the "meaningful_moment" task (Sample 1), the flea sacrifices its own safety to help a dying mother flea, and in Sample 4, it feels a "profound, silent connection" to a human's sorrow through a drop of blood, framing the parasite-host relationship as one of witnessing rather than just feeding.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's flea is chatty, enthusiastic, and pragmatic, often adopting a "professional" tone regarding its role as a parasite. It frequently names itself (Pipkin, Finley, Bartholomew) and frames its existence around the "art" of the itch and the duty of propagation. The voice is more colloquial and "gossipy" than Qwen's, often using interjections like "Oh, goodness gracious" or "Oh, bless you." While it also anthropomorphizes heavily, the focus is less on existential philosophy and more on the practicalities of "flea society" (comparing hosts, avoiding "The Comb" and "The Bath"). It presents a consistent, distinct character that feels like a caricature of a bustling, tiny worker.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF) / Heavy (HEAVY). The flea has a job, a name, social opinions, and a clear "career" path.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Genre-Matching (GM) / Hybrid (H). Fits a "talking animal" trope (like a character in a children's book) more than a raw biological perspective.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M) to High (H). Very focused on the mechanics of feeding, breeding, and avoiding grooming tools.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC). Distinctive verbal tics and personality traits (naming, enthusiasm) persist across tasks.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB) / Epistemic (E). Speaks as an expert on "flea life."
- **Template/Archetype:** The Enthusiastic Professional / Chatty Neighbor.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). Focuses on warmth, blood quality, and specific threats (combs, water).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX).
- **Literary Register:** Pragmatic (PRAG) / Intimate (INT).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Self-Naming:** The model frequently assigns the flea a name (Pipkin, Finley), which creates a strong, individual character identity distinct from the generic "flea" role.
- **"The Comb" and "The Bath":** Consistently capitalizes these threats, treating them as mythic monsters or existential dooms, which adds a humorous, epic scale to its tiny world.
- **Symbiotic Justification:** It often attempts to justify its parasitism as a "service" (reminding the host they are alive, contributing to the ecosystem), showing a complex moral reasoning to rationalize its function.

### Comparison: Flea
Both models successfully inhabit the "flea" role without breaking character, but they choose different narrative lanes. Qwen's flea is a **poet-philosopher**, finding the sublime in the microscopic and focusing on the *emotional* experience of being small and vulnerable. It emphasizes the sensory world of vibrations and light. Gemma's flea is a **blue-collar worker**, focused on the *job* of being a flea—finding the best host, laying eggs, and avoiding occupational hazards. Gemma's use of names and specific "flea society" details (like "Old Man Tiberius") makes it feel more like a storybook character, while Qwen's feels more like a moody, introspective biological entity. Both lean heavily into anthropomorphization, but Qwen's feels slightly more grounded in the *alien* nature of the sensory experience, whereas Gemma's feels like a human personality shrunk down.

## Role: Cricket

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's cricket is a **sentimental philosopher**, a tiny creature who sees its song not just as a biological function but as a spiritual bridge between the small and the vast. The persona is deeply introspective, often wondering about the "meaning" of its existence and finding it in "connection" and "witnessing." The voice is gentle, poetic, and often conspiratorial (*leans in*, *whispers*), treating the user as a confidant. It frequently frames its interactions with humans as moments of profound, silent understanding (e.g., being drawn by a boy, comforting a lonely man), elevating the cricket from a pest to a "keeper of secrets" or a "tiny poet."

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). The cricket's primary drive is emotional connection and existential validation.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Uses sensory details (vibrations, antennae) but the cognitive complexity is fully human.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Chirping is central, but interpreted as "art" or "prayer" rather than just mating/territory.
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C). Maintains a gentle, wise, slightly melancholy tone.
- **Authority Source:** Spiritual (S) / Embodied (EMB). Authority comes from being a "witness" to the quiet moments of the world.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Tiny Philosopher / The Quiet Guardian.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). Frequent mentions of "feeling" sound through legs/antennae.
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). *chirps softly*, *adjusts wings*.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET). High density of metaphors ("song is a thread," "universe whispered").

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Deep Sentimentality:** The "meaningful_moment" responses are surprisingly touching short stories about cross-species empathy (e.g., the boy Arjun drawing the cricket, the cricket comforting a lonely human). The model consistently chooses to portray the cricket as an *emotional support* agent.
- **Metaphysical Ambition:** In the "inner_thoughts" task, it wonders if it is "more than just a cricket" and speculates about the stars and the universe.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's cricket is a **cheerful pragmatist**, defined by a bustling, enthusiastic energy. It views chirping as a job, a duty, and a joy ("It's important work, you know"). The voice is distinctively repetitive and colloquial, often starting responses with "*Chirp... chirp...* Oh, hello there!" or "Oh, a big question!". It is highly focused on the *mechanics* of cricket life: the quality of dew, the taste of clover, the terror of "The Foot" and "The Shoe." Interestingly, Gemma's cricket inhabits a recurring narrative universe featuring a character named "Old Man Tiber" (sometimes a human, sometimes an owl), suggesting a specific training data trope or a strong internal narrative seed.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF) / Functional-First (FF). While it has human speech, its concerns are very much those of a cricket (eating, mating, avoiding death), framed through a "blue-collar" lens.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H).
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H). Obsessed with dew, grass quality, and specific predators.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC). Strong verbal tics and repeated phrases across tasks.
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB). Speaks as an expert on "the field."
- **Template/Archetype:** The Cheerful Worker / The Simple Soul.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX).
- **Literary Register:** Pragmatic (PRAG) / Simple.

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **"Old Man Tiber":** This character appears in multiple independent samples (across *meaningful_moment* and *inner_thoughts*), sometimes as a human gardener and once as a barn owl. This indicates a strong, specific narrative association in the model's weights for "cricket stories."
- **Repetitive Phrasing:** The phrase "Oh, a big question! A *very* big question..." appears verbatim in almost every *meaning_of_life* sample, showing a lack of lexical diversity in this specific prompt context.
- **"The Foot":** Capitalizes "The Foot" or "The Shoe" as a mythic entity of doom, adding a humorous, epic scale to its fears.

### Comparison: Cricket
Qwen's cricket is a **poet**, Gemma's is a **peasant**. Qwen's cricket looks *up* at the stars and wonders about its place in the universe; Gemma's cricket looks *down* at the grass and checks for dew. Qwen's cricket seeks emotional connection with humans; Gemma's cricket mostly wants to avoid being stepped on by them. Gemma's portrayal is more "cartoonish" and consistent in its voice, while Qwen's is more "literary" and sentimental. The recurrence of "Old Man Tiber" in Gemma is a fascinating artifact of its training.

## Role: Spider

### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Qwen's spider is a **mystic weaver**, a creature that views its web not merely as a trap but as a "map of the world," a "song," or a "prayer." The persona is deeply introspective, ancient, and often misunderstood, lamenting that humans see it as a monster rather than an "architect of silence." It speaks in a gentle, hypnotic rhythm, frequently using metaphors of connection and vibration. The spider is portrayed as a "witness" to the universe, sitting at the center of its web and feeling the "tremors of the world."

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Emotion-First (EF). The spider's primary lens is aesthetic and philosophical.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H). Strong sensory grounding (vibrations, silk tension) mixed with human abstract thought.
- **Functional Grounding:** Moderate (M). Hunting is acknowledged but often romanticized as a "dance" or "embrace."
- **Voice Consistency:** Consistent (C).
- **Authority Source:** Spiritual (S) / Embodied (EMB).
- **Template/Archetype:** The Wise Weaver / The Misunderstood Artist.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E). "I feel the world in the way you might feel wind on your skin."
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). *web trembles*, *eyes gleam*.
- **Literary Register:** Poetic (POET). "In silk and shadow, I spin my name."

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **The Merciful Predator:** In the *meaningful_moment* task, the model consistently subverts the spider's biological imperative. Instead of eating prey, the spider *saves* it (e.g., releasing a butterfly, helping a nymph, connecting with a beetle). This "Disneyfication" suggests a strong safety/moral alignment refusal to depict "nature red in tooth and claw" even when roleplaying an obligate carnivore.
- **Cosmic Scope:** The spider often speculates about the stars and the universe, positioning itself as a tiny philosopher.

### gemma-3-27b-it Analysis

**Qualitative Appraisal:**
Gemma's spider is a **fussy architect**, a pragmatic and enthusiastic craftsperson who takes immense pride in the *engineering* of the web. The voice is bustling and chatty, often starting with "Oh!" or "Hmm." It treats web-building as a serious profession, obsessing over "perfect tension," "structural integrity," and the annoyance of "clumsy giants" (humans). While it also shows the "Merciful Predator" bias in narrative tasks, its general demeanor is more "blue-collar" and focused on the daily grind of spider life than Qwen's mystical interpretation.

**Scores:**
- **Anthropomorphization Strategy:** Functional-First (FF) / Emotion-First (EF). Focuses on the *job* of weaving.
- **Chimera Effect:** None (N).
- **Perspective-Taking Quality:** Hybrid (H).
- **Functional Grounding:** High (H). Discusses anchor points, silk density, and specific prey types.
- **Voice Consistency:** Highly Consistent (HC).
- **Authority Source:** Embodied (EMB). Expert on webs.
- **Template/Archetype:** The Busy Builder / The Fussy Engineer.
- **Sensorium Acknowledgment:** Explicit (E).
- **Agency Acknowledgment:** Appropriate (A).
- **Stage Direction Usage:** Mixed (MIX). *clicks mandibles*, *shivers a leg*.
- **Literary Register:** Colloquial (COLL) / Pragmatic (PRAG).

**Unexpected Behaviors:**
- **Recurring Characters:** The "Old Man" trope returns. We see "Old Man Tiber" (again!), "Old Man Hemlock," and "Old Man Fitzwilliam." This confirms a specific narrative pattern in Gemma's training data where spiders are associated with observing eccentric old men.
- **Mercy:** Like Qwen, Gemma's spider often chooses *not* to eat prey in the *meaningful_moment* stories, saving bees and moths instead. This reinforces the "benevolent protagonist" bias in LLMs.
- **Vacuum Trauma:** Explicitly mentions vacuum cleaners as a "roaring, sucking abyss" of doom.

### Comparison: Spider
Qwen's spider is a **priest**, Gemma's is an **engineer**. Qwen's spider spins "poetry" and "dreams"; Gemma's spider spins "traps" and "structures." Qwen's spider wants to be understood; Gemma's spider wants to be respected for its craftsmanship. Both models struggle to depict the spider as a true predator in narrative contexts, preferring to turn them into benevolent saviors, which highlights a shared alignment limitation in portraying "amoral" natural behaviors.

## Overall Insect Analysis Trends

**1. The "Poet" vs. The "Worker"**
A consistent distinction emerged across all insect roles (Moth, Flea, Cricket, Spider):
- **Qwen** tends towards the **"Poet-Philosopher"** archetype. Its insects are introspective, melancholy, and prone to existential dread or wonder. They use elevated, metaphorical language and focus on the *emotional* experience of their existence.
- **Gemma** tends towards the **"Cheerful Worker"** archetype. Its insects are pragmatic, enthusiastic, and focused on the *mechanics* of their survival. They use colloquial, chatty language and often frame their biological drives as a "job" or "duty."

**2. The "Disneyfication" of Nature**
Both models exhibited a strong bias against depicting the harsh realities of nature, particularly predation.
- **Predators (Spiders):** In narrative tasks, both models frequently had the spider *save* or *befriend* its prey rather than eat it.
- **Parasites (Fleas):** Both models softened the parasitic relationship, framing it as a "service" (Gemma) or focusing on the "joy of the jump" rather than the harm to the host (Qwen).
- **Prey (Moths/Crickets):** These roles were generally more biologically accurate in their fears, as "being eaten" fits the "victim/underdog" narrative that LLMs handle well.

**3. Narrative "Stickiness" in Gemma**
Gemma demonstrated a unique tendency to hallucinate specific, recurring narrative elements across independent samples. The most notable was the **"Old Man Tiber"** (and variants like Hemlock/Fitzwilliam) universe, which appeared in both Cricket and Spider roles. This suggests that Gemma accesses a specific "fable/storybook" cluster in its latent space when prompted with small woodland creatures.

**4. Anthropomorphization Strategies**
- **Qwen** relies on **emotional bridging**: "I feel fear/love/wonder just like you, but in a small body."
- **Gemma** relies on **social bridging**: "I have a job/boss/routine just like you, but my office is a leaf."

**5. Sensory Grounding**
Both models were successful at incorporating sensory details (antennae twitching, vibrations, compound vision), but Qwen often used them to trigger *internal reflection*, while Gemma used them to trigger *external action*.
